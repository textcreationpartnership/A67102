            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eligion, that choiſe <hi>Evangelical Pearle. Matth 13.</hi> the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and richeſt Treaſure God hath bequeathed to Chriſtians, though found and strongly guarded, meet's yet with many who long ſince, had their weak attempts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, would haue thrown it out of the world. Atheiſt's deny à Deity, the only fundation of Religion, Iewes oppoſe Chriſt, the great Maſter of Truth, and Heretiques band againſt an euidenced vniverſal Church, that large field wherein this precious Iewel is found. Theſe Aduerſaries we encounter, and our deſign is both to vnbeguile and ſilence them. In the first place we attaque thoſe groſſer Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Atheiſts, Iewes, Turks, and Infidels. This done, we enter vpon the main matter, and freindly treat with our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<pb facs="tcp:102688:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> Sectaries by the force of plain and vndeniable Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: If theſe ſtand (which none can shake) Proteſtancy fall's to nothing. I call this Treatiſe the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> where you haue the Inducements, which lead to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of true Religion clearly propoſed, and strongly Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt all Oppoſers, whoſe cauils and Calumnies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to truth, will appear as they are vain and forceles, after due ponderation of the Principles we rely on.</p>
            <p>The prudent ſearch after Religion is euer made and firſt begun with Reaſon, or à rational diſcourſe, for I hold this Principle indubitable. None can aſſent to the high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed Myſteries of Faith, without preuious euidence <hi>had</hi> of their <hi>Credibility</hi> laid forth to reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now becauſe Atheiſts, Arians, and all Heretiques, hold what they teach reaſonable, it is neceſſary to distinguish between <hi>falſe and true Reaſon,</hi> as alſo rigidly to Examin what euer belongs to that whole Matter, which is amply done in the <hi>14<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 15<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
               </hi> and, <hi>16<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
               </hi> Chapters of the third Diſcourſe, where we prove that Religion is only Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, which Heaven it ſelfe declares reaſonable, by ſuch viſible, ſenſible, and illuſtrious Marks as haue gained Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to believe in Chriſt, and no other but God's Infinite Power and wiſdom, can produce. Herevpon, we lay forth the ſignal Marks of the Roman Catholick Church, clear Cogniſances of an Infinite Power and VViſdom, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb facs="tcp:102688:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> moſt euident, Converſions of Nations wrought by Her, Succeſsion of Paſtors, euer ſince the Apoſtles preached, with à ſtrict vnity of one Faith in all that Profeſſed Her Doctrin. VVe look next vpon this late <hi>riſen Proteſtancy</hi> and find it naked, vtterly ſtrip't of all ſupernatural Motives: No Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, no Conuerſions, no vnity in Faith to countenance the Nouelty, and therefore conclude that the Profeſſors of it who ſeemingly stand for Reaſon, and ſlight an euidenced Church, are moſt vnreaſonable, and as dayly experience teaches, meer Scepticks in Matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clemens Rom. in Recog: D. Petri.</hi> hereafter cited, gives this wiſe Counſel to euery prudent ſeeker after Truth. Before all things examin well by the light of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Motiues; whether one that pretend's to ſpeak in the name of God, and call's himſelfe à Prophet ſent to preach, proues himſelfe to be really ſo. Thus much learned (and the knowledge is eaſily gained, becauſe grounded vpon eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) belieue boldly all he teaches, though his Doctrin be ſublime, and ſeem's difficult to weak reaſon. The firſt conuerted Chriſtians were thus induced by the Lustre of our Sauiours glorious Miracles and other Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wonders, to own him as he was, à great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or the true Meſsias ſent from God, and afterward belieued what euer Doctrin he taught, vpon his own Infallible word. Apply what is here ſaid to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church, you will find this great Truth
<pb facs="tcp:102688:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> made manifest in the following Diſcourſes. viz. <hi>That as no Prophet, no Doctor, ever came neer Chriſt our Lord in the wonders he wrought, ſo no Society of men ſince thé world ſtood, was, or is Comparable in Miracles and other Cognizances of truth, to the Roman Catholick Church.</hi> She as I now ſaid, and no other Society, shewes you à Continued Succeſsion of Paſtors, of Princes, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſince the firſt Plantation of the Goſpel. She and no other, hath been always reverenced all Nations over, and was neuer oppoſed by Orthodox Chriſtians. She giues you à large Catalogue of Innumerable Profeſſors eminent in learning, in wiſdom, and ſanctity of life. In Her the ancient Predictions of Prophets, are literally fulfilled. Her vniuerſal extent far and neer, is euident; The Conuerſions wrought by her, Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The Courage and Conſtancy of Martyrs who dyed for her Faith, Euident. Her ancient Poſſeſsion of truth (for Confeſſedly she was once Orthodox) is vndeniable, And this is the Church, Gentle Reader, our Sectaries would deſtroy, This Oracle, though ſignalized with ſo many Illuſtrious Marks, and Indications proceeding from God, inſpite of Heaven, they iniuriouſly Calumniate as Idolatrous, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, And Conſequently make thoſe Millions and Millions, who both liuing and dying zealouſly ſought to ſerve no other but the great God of Truth in this bleſſed Society,
<pb facs="tcp:102688:4"/> Fools, Madmen, Idolaters, and Heretiques. <hi>I ſay Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate,</hi> for all they haue done hitherto, or can do for the future, comes to no more but to à flat iniurious Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as is euidenced in the third Diſcourſe. <hi>C. 19.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re you are told, that whoever impeaches an ancient Church (once acknowledged Orthodox) of Idolatry, and proves not his charge, by clear and vndeniable Principles, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniates muſt vniustly, and ſin's damnably, Proteſtants do ſo, as is there largely proued, and the truth is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in their own writings. They tell vs the Roman Catholick Church though once right in Faith, changed Her ancient Doctrin, we iuſtly vrge them to prove the Aſſertion by ſome vnqueſtionable Principles, more convincing, or of greater weight and ſtrength to perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de what they aſſert, then the publick judgement of all ſound Chriſtians liuing at that time, to perſwade the Contrary; And Mark à ſtrange Proceeding, the Calumny it ſelfe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vpon vs, without either Proof or probable Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to vphold it, but their own bare and proofles word. VVe are told again, there was euer à Catholick Church without blemish, at leaſt in fundamentals, (for that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Creed. <hi>I believe the Holy Catholick Church</hi> was true in all Ages) VVe ſeriouſly demand where, or in what part of Chriſtendom that Orthodox Church (distinct from the Roman Catholick) had its
<pb facs="tcp:102688:5"/> being at that time, when the Roman fell from Chriſt, and became Idolatrous? There was ſuch à Church which cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and condemned the ſuppoſed Roman Errours, or not; If not, the world vpon thoſe ſuppoſed errours, was wholly Churchles. Grant an Orthodox Church distinct from the Roman, She certainly oppoſed thoſe Imagined falſe Roman Doctrins, which then began to infect the Moral Body of Chriſtians, and Conſequently that Oppoſition was à thing as notoriouſly known, as loudly noiſed ſome Centuries ſince, as it is Notoriouſly known and noiſed, that our Sectaries haue now espied thoſe falſe Doctrins. VVe vrge them to bring to light that publick known Oppoſition of their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined Church, againſt the Roman Catholick Society fancied à Changling, And what haue we? Deep ſilence from ſome, and from ſuch as dare ſpeak, falſe Suppoſitions for Proofs, vnworthy Calumnies for an Anſwer. Pleaſe to ſe this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument fully handled. Diſc. 2. C. 6.</p>
            <p>Time was, the world knowes well, when our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries auouched they could prove their Proteſtancy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute our Catholick Doctrin by plain and expreſs-Scripture, we come to the true Trial in this Treatiſe, and in lieu of God's word, find their Books full fraught with meer far-fetcht Gloſſes. Not one Paſſage I boldly aſſert, (and put Sectaries to the Proof) fauours this Proteſtancy, as it is diſtinguished from Popery, and the known Hereſies of
<pb facs="tcp:102688:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> former Ages. Now that nothing from Scripture can be alleged Contrary to our Catholick Doctrin, is manifest vpon this one Principle, which none shall overthrow. VVhat Scripture faithfully interpreted teaches in theſe weighty matters of Religion, ſome Orthodox Church deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in foregoing Ages: For example. If Scripture deny Adoration to Chriſt in the Bleſſed Sacrament, or Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, an Orthodox Church, which cannot clash with the verities of God's word, in ſome Age or other maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theſe Proteſtant Tenets, and published them to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, But no Orthodox Church euer ſided with Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or taught ſuch Doctrins, Therefore their pretence to Scripture against our Catholick Tenets is friuolous, and implies no more but à falſe ſuppoſition for à Proof. And this ſtrain of turning bare Suppoſitions into proofs, which never go beyond the ſtrength of their own vnproued Aſſertions, ſo vniuerſally trancends all their Polemicks that I ſtand aſtonished, to ſe men who will be accounted learned, wholly buſied in doing Nothing. Reflect <hi>I</hi> beſeech you à lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. They haue been told, and <hi>I</hi> remind them of it again in this Treatiſe, that whoeuer makes the Roman Church Idolatrous or Erroneous, muſt hold the ſuppoſed Idolatry and errour ſo remediles an Euil, that none on earth can redreſs either, becauſe all the Proofs or Principles whereby the Reformation should be made, will euidently appear leſs pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
<pb facs="tcp:102688:6"/> to Euince this Church guilty of errour, then Her ſole Authority is to perſwade the Contrary, viz. That she neuer erred. VVherefore Sectaries Confeſſedly fallible men, deſperatly adventure to reform vs, and cannot but ſpoile all they go about to mend, whilſt they Euidence not, whilst they plead not, by the Authority of an Antient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church which taught that very Proteſtancy they teach now, and decryed theſe Suppoſed Popish errours as loudly as they decry them: But to do thus much is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as manifeſtly appears by their own writings, For tell me <hi>I</hi> beſeech you, whoever yet heard Protestant in all tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe weak skirmishes made againſt Catholick Religion, <hi>Say plainly and prove it.</hi> Such à Church reputed Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox fiue or Six Ages ſince, taught as we teach, ſenſed Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as we ſenſe them, Chriſtians then vniuerſally belieued no Real Preſence, No ſacrifice of the Maſſe &amp;c. Has euer Proteſtant, I ſay, gon thus groundedly to work? No, Moſt euidently, No. I shall highly extoll the man that will dare to proceed ſo ingenuouſly, but find none engaged in this right way of Arguing. Its true, ſome who leap over the heads of all their more Immediate Anceſtors, between Luther and the three or four first Centuries, tell vs thoſe Primitiue Chriſtians were good Proteſtants like them. Ill luck Say I that Proteſtancy had, not to be intailed vpon ſome Succeſſors in following Ages, for moſt certainly ſince
<pb facs="tcp:102688:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> thoſe dayes, the world neuer ſaw Proteſtant before Luther. In à word the Aſſertion is à loud vntruth, an vnworthy begging of Queſtion, and beſides implies à fancied ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for à Proof. To show this, we reduce theſe ranging Spirits to a leſſer compaſs, and oblige them to name but one Proteſtant, neerer their shameful Reuolt from our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Society. Here they ſtand grauelled, as mute as fishes, and are highly angry, becauſe we touch them where they are moſt weak.</p>
            <p>This want of à Church to ground Proteſtancy vpon, makes their Polemicks to be as they appear, <hi>rambling, faint, shallow,</hi> and ſo disſatisfactory, that great patience is requiſite to peruſe them. VVonder nothing, they can do no better, Rebells they are against an antient Church, and their handling Controuerſies may well be compared with the proceeding of Rebells in à Common wealth, who cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly mark, and diligently attend to what euer may ſeem welcome to your ignorant, ſeduced, and disguſted Multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, That, be it what you will, is fomented, that's laid forth, and inculcated. It is no newes to tell you, that our Miniſters in England now for à long time, haue had à number of ſeduced People bread in their own rebellious boſomes, and brought vp in à spirit of Schiſm, who God knowes haue heard little, but of the Idolatry, of the Superſtitions, and wickednes of ſome Profeſſed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.
<pb facs="tcp:102688:7"/> O, ſay theſe Incendiaries, we will nourish this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular humour with food ſuitable to its palate, we will write Books of this Popish Idolatry, we haue tongues and can poyſon with delight, we will lay forth <hi>in folio</hi> what we conceiue of the Roman Superſtiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ns, and the wickednes of Popes. VVe know well to Cauil, and how to enſnare the vulgar, on vvhom we depend, when our Cauils are once out, though neither reducible to Principles, nor ſubiect to the Cenſure of any Iudge (for we own none) let them shift for themſelves. Our only care is to talk on, though we prove nothing, And chiefly to be vvary in one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, It is never to mention any thing of à Church which taught Proteſtancy before Luther, meddle vvith that Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiuous difficulty vve are vndon, for really vve have no ſuch Church. This in à word (and much vvorſe) is Proteſtancy, as is amply declared in the following Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, vvhere you alſo haue the diſtinctiue Cogniſances of Chriſt's true Church, the Rule of Faith, and the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of à Rule explained; vvithall, an eaſy vvay vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to put an end to theſe vnfortunate Controverſies. You haue moreover the Infallibility of the Roman Catholick Church aſſerted, Faith reſolued into its true Principles, Mr Stillingfleets groſſer Errours diſcouered, The Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Catholick Religion laid forth to euery rational man, And to omit other Questions (all cannot be hinted
<pb facs="tcp:102688:7"/> at in the narrow compaſſe of à Preface) you haue this <hi>great Truth proved.</hi> viz. That if the Roman Catholick Church hath taught but one falſe Article, and obliged all Chriſtians to belieue it vnder pain of damnation, there neither is at this day, nor was before Luther any true faith in the world. VVherefore Sectaries who haue made it their chiefe buſines to impeach our Church of Idolatry, and Hereſy (and the louder they cryed, the more they thought to deſtroy vs) haue done their vtmost to ruin all the Churches on earth, and proue themſelues thereby both Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and Churchles. But enough for à Preface. Open and read. Approue or condemn, as reaſon shall guide you. In caſe you Condemn, pleaſe to ſay, VVhy, and shew me where I erre in Principles. Pardon the faults of the Printer which are many (he is à ſtranger to our Language) except againſt mine boldly, if you find any, but do it with Charity, and ſtill, for this <hi>I</hi> muſt inculcate again and again, <hi>Remember Principles.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Lain dealing is the beſt, you shall haue it in this short Advertiſement from à friendly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary (no Enemy I aſſure you) who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to do you good, againſt your will. If I be rightly informed, Both you and ſome others find your ſelves diſſatisfied vpon this ſcore, that your <hi>Rational Account</hi> (as tis called) <hi>comprehending the Grounds of Proteſtant Religion,</hi> remain's yet vntouch't, or not anſwered. Before I reply to theſe complaints, I shall take the boldnes to requeſt one fauour at your hands (you will much oblige me by it) which is to point out that <hi>Chapter</hi> or <hi>Paragraph</hi> through your whole Book, wherein the hidden treaſure of theſe <hi>Proteſtant Grounds</hi> lie, and to giue me in à few lines, one or two of them plainly ſet down in halfe à Sheet of paper. I ſpeak of Grounds for Proteſtancy, as it is your peculiar Religion diſtinct from Popery, and all known Condemned He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reties. Fob me not off, I beſeech you, with any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral talk, Tell me not I muſt ſeek better and shall find, For, Sr, I aſſure you though I haue made à dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Search after your Grounds, they are yet ſo far remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from my ſight, that I cannot find one. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="tcp:102688:8"/> becauſe you are more Conuerſant in your own writings then others, and, <hi>Plus vident oculi quam oculus,</hi> I beg to be enlightned by you. If you fail to do this, the world will iudge as I do, that you haue abuſed the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with à Title, wherevnto nothing in your volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Book anſwer's. I mean you haue no more touched vpon Grounds for Proteſtancy (as Proteſtancy and mark my words) then for Arianiſm, or any other falſe Religion.</p>
            <p>In the peruſal of your Book I ſe what beguiled you. You, Sr, thought to throw that little dirt (wherewith ſome haue furnished you) in our faces, was enough to make your bad cauſe Specious, and to prop vp your Proteſtancy, as if forſooth to Cavil at vs, were to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish your Novelties. Know good Sr, that both Arians and all other gone Heretiques, were as fierce in their Cauils againſt the Church as you are, but did they therefore either ground or eſtablish their falſe Doctrins contrary to Gods Truths? It is à groſs errour to think ſo; For as it is one thing foolishly to brandish à Sword, and another fitly to vſe à Buckler, ſo it is à quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent buſines ſlightly to impugn Catholick Religion, and another to defend Proteſtancy. Tht firſt you haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted like your old Heretiques, and with as ill ſucceſs; But the ſecond, which is to maintain Proteſtancy, or to ſettle that vpon ſolid Grounds, neither is, nor was, nor euer shall be done by any, wherefore I tell you in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Treatiſe (read it if you pleaſe) This Proteſtancy is wholly vngrounded, God never revealed one Article of it (as Proteſtancy) nor did ever antient or modern Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church teach ſo much as one of your <hi>Particular
<pb facs="tcp:102688:9"/> Tenets,</hi> And for this reaſon I ſay, its falſly called the <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion,</hi> hauing neither Eſſence, nor the Properties of Religion belonging to it.</p>
            <p>Now for as much as Concern's your Clamours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you think your Book neglected, or not yet An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Firſt, give me leave to tell you, it is a great Vanity to riſe to ſo high à conceipt of your ſelfe or of your Book (as if you were the only Defender of your Faith) and à greater to publish it to the world. what think you, Cannot Proteſtancy be impugned without taking you or your work in hand? Its little wiſdom to iudge ſo. A Souldier, good Sir, who intend's to inuade an enemy takes no directions from him, how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Country, much leſs buſies his thoughts about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing euery ſtraw, or euery little block that lies in his way, but marches on, as he thinks beſt to compaſs his Deſign. To ouerthrow your Proteſtancy is our Deſign, and you moſt vnreaſonably preſcribe, what we are to do, That is, we muſt either attaque your <hi>Fort</hi> and meddle with your <hi>Account,</hi> or you think nothing is done. Why ſo I beſeech you? Grant, which is not true that thoſe who haue written ſince your Account ſaw light, paſſed by it without much notice, they might well do ſo, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on it as à Block not worth remouing, vnleſs, as I ſay, you will haue them to obey your Commands, and aſſault what Outwork you pleaſe. <hi>It is Sr, your Cauſe we more mind, then your Account.</hi> 2. Why do you (or ſome body for you) not only shamefully ſtopp all the Preſſes, in ſo much that ſcarſe a sheet of paper can appear in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick; But moreover, why haue you (when all liberty is granted to ſcrible and print what you pleaſe) omitted to
<pb facs="tcp:102688:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> Anſwer thoſe Bookes, which directly impugn your Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin. That excellent <hi>Guide of Controuerſies</hi> is the <hi>One,</hi> and Proteſtancy without Principles, the <hi>other:</hi> And you haue done this with much vncivil ſcornful Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, with a meer forced Pish from the teeth outward at the end of a Preface, as if, forſooth, you would be thought to Say; <hi>You Could Anſwer but vvill not, vvbereas the naked truth is</hi> (at leaſt wiſe men Iudge ſo) <hi>you would Anſwer but, Cannot.</hi> Sr, believe me, it would have been much to the purpoſe, and far more ſatisfactory to your Proteſtant Brethren, had you, when you ſaw your Proteſtancy (to ſpeak moderatly) well shaken in thoſe two Books, replyed to ſome particulars, and shewed where either the Principles were falſe, or their Diſcourſes failed, But you Cowardly quitted the field, ſate down ſilent, buſying your ſelfe with reprinting a few Sermons, whereof the world had no need at all. And this (t'is thought) was done to cloak your Lazines, your ignorance or both, becauſe you could not Anſwer, yet we are called on to quarrel with you, whilſt you like a Priuiledged Perſon exempt your ſelfe from medling with vs. That is we muſt ſpeak, and you ſay nothing.</p>
            <p>But, Sr, let vs come neerer the point and tell you truth. Whatever you account ſubſtantial in your Book, hath been anſwered by your two ſcorned Aduerſaries, and if any thing be yet wanting, it is amply ſupplyed in this Treatiſe. To conceiue what I would proue, pleaſe to Note. There are two wayes in anſwering a Booke. The one is to follow an Author ſtep after ſtep, by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining ſeverally each piece of the <hi>VVhole:</hi> The other is to Conſider the Principles wherevpon the <hi>VVhole</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes,
<pb facs="tcp:102688:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> shewing them either falſe in themſelues, or not connex't with thoſe Concluſions which should follow from them. <hi>Deſtroy Principles, you deſtroy all.</hi> Thus the Motion of à Watch may be ſpoiled two wayes, either by diſordering euery wheel in it, à part, or by breaking the Spring. The faireſt Palace ever was, is ruine'd, if either you ſeparate euery ſtone from ſtone, or if you vndermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the fundation and blow vp the whole Fabrick, though many of the ſtones ſtrongly Cimented, cling yet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The firſt way of anſwering by piece-meal, is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and obſcure, and as things are with vs (by reaſon of the difficulty in Printing and transmitting Bookes into England) almoſt impoſſible, The other is clear and eaſy, both are ſatisfactory to euery rational man, and I hold the ſecond moſt neceſſary, For, in all our Diſcourſes the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re muſt be ſome firm Principles laid wherevnto we redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and from whence wè draw what we Aſſert, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral wayes of diſcourſing, Compoſe the two different Methods, <hi>Analytical and Synthetical,</hi> obſerucd by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Divines. Neither is the Foundation more neceſſary to à houſe, or the weight to a clock, then Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are to a Diſcourſe, which then is good, when the grounds ſtand firm, and the Deductions of the particular Concluſion from them, <hi>clear:</hi> But if either the Principles be falſe and alien, or the Deductions not Coherent, the whole Diſcourſe fall's to nothing.</p>
            <p>Apply what is here ſayd to your Account, or rather to the Religion it Aſſerts, and you have all I would Say. Your Account, Sr, was writ to vindicate Proteſtancy, and muſt ſtand vpon the ſame Principles with that Nouelty, therefore whatever shak's and ruin's the Principles of
<pb facs="tcp:102688:10"/> Proteſtancy, neceſſarily shak's, and ruin's the Principles of your Account, But your Suppoſed Principles or Grounds of Proteſtancy are broken, yea demonſtrated no Grounds at all, in the Book intitl'd <hi>Proteſtancy without Principles,</hi> where they arc proued either falſe, or no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples peculiar to your Religion, as it is diſtinct from the Doctrin of other Societies, called <hi>Non-Protestants,</hi> And conſequently when true, they haue no Connexion with Proteſtancy, nor can lead in any concluſion for you, And where they are falſe, their falſity is laid before your eyes, and an vtter ſubuerſion of your Cauſe, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with it, becauſe neither can ſtand, when your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Principles are deſtroyed, or rather found never to have had Being. And thus your Book is ſolidly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. If you deſire to ſe more ruin yet fallen vpon you, read this Treatiſe, and be pleaſed to reflect vpon theſe three things in your Account. The <hi>length of it,</hi> The <hi>Obiections against Catholick Religion,</hi> and finally your Principles for Proteſtancy. We find two of them, but miſſe the third. The length mighty tedious, and (too often without ſubſtance) wearies à Reader, God help him (ſay I) that vndergoes the druggery to turn ouer all the vneuen ſtuff which lies heap't vp there. Your Obiections, vſually borrowed from Mr Chillingworth and ſome other Proteſtant Writers, are for the moſt part common, and ſuch as haue been anſwered ouer and ouer: Where you think them peculiar to your ſelfe (as they lay in my way) I haue reioyned, and if ſome be omitted, that's only to Say, euery ſtone in your Fabrick is not touched, or medled with, But for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns your Principles in behalfe of Proteſtancy, I As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
<pb facs="tcp:102688:11"/> Confidently, you haue none, and vpon this ground, I ſay once more your Account is anſwered.</p>
            <p>Goe on therefore, and vilify the works published againſt you as you pleaſe, call them <hi>Wool ſacks, Rats,</hi> or <hi>Flies,</hi> add more opprobrious language to gain you credit among your ſimple and too credulous Vulgar, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Readers you preuail nothing, who well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, it Matters not to your Intent, if thoſe <hi>VVool ſacks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and break the force of your greateſt shot againſt our Church; if the <hi>Rats</hi> gnaw the beſt ligaments wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in your Account, if but one of theſe flies enter your throat, and bereaue you of breath (ſome report of à great man ſtifled by à Fly) And truly it ſeem's by your deep ſilence, or not anſwering ſince theſe Books came forth, that ſome of the greater ſort haue halfe chok'd you. <hi>But enough.</hi> To <hi>ſay</hi> more after this ſtrain, were to rallie like you, and to offend the learned world, which requires ſubſtance in theſe ſerious matters, without contempt, flowting, and empty words. Had you, Sr, gone the right way to work, you should either haue kept in your diſdainful language, or taken <hi>Proteſtancy without Principles in hand,</hi> Shewing, where the Author miſtook your Principles, Or whether his exceptions were blamable, becauſe he thought them either Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and not belonging to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> wholly alien from your cauſe, wholly impertinent to Maintain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy. This proceeding had been Satisfactory, but difficult and aboue your force, Therefore you wiſely waued it, knowing well it was eaſier to gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e sharp words, and ſnarle at your Aduerſaries, than to come neer and bite, with pinching Arguments.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:102688:11"/>
            <p>My proceeding with you, Sr, is quite contrary, I ſlight nor your perſon, but ſay plainly where your great miſtake lies in handling Controuerſies. You run head-long into the deep Myſteries of Faith by the ill conduct of your weak, or not well ſighted reaſon, and after à few ſtagg ring thoughts ſpent in weighing, and muſing vpon the difficulties, which appear to you in the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, you will needs tell vs what's true, what's falſe, and therefore boldly take, and reiect, as you like beſt. It is à perplexed way, Sr, which will neuer make, you either Good Chriſtian, good Diuine, or ſo much as à mean Proficient in Chriſt's School. In following it, you are juſt like one (as I tell you in the Treatiſe) that takes wholſome Pills into his Mouth, chewes them, find's them bitter, and ſpitt's all out. Hence it is, you ſpit at the Doctrins of Tranſubſtantiation, of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory &amp;c. becauſe forſooth, they are diſtaſtful to ſenſe and shallow reaſon. And truly, Sr, it is wonderful, that you haue not long ſince by this procedure, caſt off the Doctrin of the ſacred Trinity, For moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might ſenſe and weak reaſon plead the Cauſe here, far greater difficulties would occur againſt that ſublime Myſtery, then euer Proteſtants yet propoſed againſt our other Catholick Tenents. In a word, Sr, if you deſire ſatisfaction in matters of Religion, buſy not your head with the examination of the Diuine Myſteries <hi>Conſidered in themſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> they are aboue your reach, but contrarywi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, conſider well, how and by what means they are made <hi>Credible</hi> to reaſon, which is done as S. Auſtin, cited af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, tell's you, by firſt finding out that clear marked, and ſignalized Church, whereby God ſpeaks, This
<pb facs="tcp:102688:12"/> Oracle once diſcouered (and the Diſcouery grounded vpon Euidence, is eaſy) <hi>Hear and Believe Her,</hi> She is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then you, and never think to shake ſo ſtrong à For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, by deviſing pcrty Arguments againſt Her Doctrin (no ſooner ſeen then ſolued) becauſe, forſooth, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Comprehend it.</p>
            <p>But it is high time to end and I shall do ſo, with one word more of good aduice. Fooles they ſay may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give à wiſe man Counſel. Sr, if you intend to write any more, Conſider for your own ſake, what you write, weigh things well in your thoughts, before they paſs your pen. Haue alwaies this one reflexion in mind. <hi>Its eaſy to Cauil, eaſy to talk much,</hi> but moſt labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to make ſure what you ſay, by ſound Principles, And Principles your Aduerſaries euer haue an Eye to. Had you complyed with this Aduice, the greateſt part of your Account (if not all) might well have been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Never rely on the vain prayſes of your vulgar Readers, all is not gold that gliſters in their Eyes, nor do they alwayes ſpeak as they think. For as much as concern's your ſelfe, shew, sr, rather the ſtrength of à Father in louing your works, then the weaknes of à fond Mother that hugg's her Brats, though moſt defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. I am told, you imagin it à great Acchieuement, and your ſelfe the conquerour, in hauing gain'd onc pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man T. C. to follow your triumphant Chariot, Abuſe not your Iudgement there is no ſuch matter, for in good ſober earneſt by what I haue peruſed in T. C. <hi>his book rather ſeem's to be an anſwer to yours, then yours to his.</hi> Abſtain hereafter from opprobrious Language, leſt you meet with ſome ruffing Adverſary that will pay you in
<pb facs="tcp:102688:12"/> your own Coyn. Pleaſe to vſe your Buckler better in behalfe of Proteſtancy, and tell me when your Negatiue Articles are thrown away (<hi>as not reuealed) what eſſential Truth remain's vvithin the Compaſſe of Proteſtancy, reuealed by Almighty God, and neceſſary to Saluation.</hi> If you think it the wiſeſt Courſe, not to take notice of what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed againſt you in this Treatiſe, vouchſafe to clear your ſelfe of the Contradictions charged vpon you. And becauſe I find you much intangled in your Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Faith, and haue laid your miſtakes open to publick view; when the Spirit of anſwering fall's vpon you again, Anſwer I beſeech you, to the difficulties Obiected in the third Diſcourſe, But aboue all Anſwer to God with à hearty repentance, for the wrong you haue done his Church, and own me.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>VVhether true Religion be in the world? The Affirmative proved Againſt Atheists. Atheiſm, evidently Shewd'improbable.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe queſtion may perhaps ſeem doubtful to many, upon<note place="margin">Different judgements Concerning true Religion</note> theſe grounds. Firſt. Who euer admit's of Religion muſt either hold it true upon the Authority of others, or becauſe he is perſwaded it can be found out by his own ſearch and induſtry. If he relies on Authority, He meet's with as many Pretenders to truth as there are different Profeſſors of Religions on earth. The<note place="margin">The moſt of men pretend to it.</note> Iew pleads for his as the moſt ancient, the Chriſtian for his, the Turk for his, the Heathen for following the light of nature, and every one thinks well of his own way, and votes his own Religion beſt. If therfore à ſearcher after truth relies on Authority, He can no more (ſay theſe) take the Chriſtians word than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, the Heathens then the Jewes, the Jewes then the Turks, the<note place="margin">The diffical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the choiſe.</note> Arians then the Catholicks, the Catholicks than the Proteſtants, and Conſequently ought in prudence to reject all Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the other ſide, if He chuſe à Religion by the force of his private judgement only, or own induſtry, He is caſt into à La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth and shall never find an <hi>exit.</hi> He is obliged in prudence to make à diligent ſearch into all the different Sects which are, or have bin ſince the firſt creation of things: He is carefully to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102688:21"/> examin the cauſes of them, the grounds they rely on, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion or coherence they have with one an other; He is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the learned of theſe different Religions, or read their books, and then to pitch by his own erring judgement on what likes him beſt, which perhaps may be worſt of all. This task you ſee is immenſe and no leſſe unſuccesful than laborious, mans life is ſpent, before halfe the work be done. Therfore it ſeems, none can come to the certain knowledge of true Religion either by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or reaſon. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſaith the Opponent, there is no ſuch thing as true Religion in Being.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Contrariwiſe I ſay. True Religion moſt evidently is in the<note place="margin">True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The reaſon of the Aſſertion.</note> world. The Aſſertion is grounded on this certain verity: God eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally exiſting by himſelf without cauſe, and infinite in all perfection is in Being; therfore true Religion cannot but bee alſo. For Grant ſuch à <hi>Being</hi> as God is, neceſſary of himſelf without any ſuperiour cauſe, it followes He is to be adored by all rational creatures eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially inferiour to him, and not by any falſe, or mock-worship, but in <hi>Spirit and Truth,</hi> for ſuch an adoration only ſuites his Divine natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.<note place="margin">Of the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration due to God.</note> This reaſon is reinforced by the light of one indubitable Maxim. <hi>Quod univerſis videtur, eſt verum.</hi> What appeares to all, or at leaſt, to the moſt Civillized Nations to be à Truth, is ſo: for ſuch à uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſent of nature is the Dictamen and voice of God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of nature; But all Nations ever owned ſome Religion, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this agreement of God and nature is à Truth. The minor is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent<note place="margin">All civilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Nations own à Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> (to ſay nothing of Chriſtians) out of the very writings of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens who aſſure us, though people are found ſo barbarous as to live without lawes, learning, or civil goverment, yet no whole nation was ever yet heard of, but owned ſome kind of <hi>Numen,</hi> ſome ſacrifice, ſome homage, ſome worship due to à power either <hi>falſly</hi> or <hi>truely</hi> judged worthy of Reverence and honour. Neither is the<note place="margin">One difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty removed.</note> force of the Argument infringed by ſaying, many and very many Nations erred in the Truth of Religion, which may ſeem as great an Evil as to have none, for thus much is only proved at preſent, that the voice of nature more eaſily ownes Religion then it profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes one true; That therfore being the univerſal Teſtimony or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102688:21"/> conſent of all, cannot be falſe. <hi>Haec teſtimonia animae</hi> (its Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians Doctrin which S. Cyprian borrowed from him) <hi>quanto vera, tanto ſimplicia, quanto ſimplicia, tanto vulgaria</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This general Truth by how much more pure and ſimple, by ſo much it's more vulgarly known, by how much more vulgarly known, by ſo much its more common, by how much more common, by ſo much it's more natural, by how much more natural, by ſo much it's more Divine. Omni literaturâ notius</hi> (ſaith Tertullian) <hi>omni Doctrinâ agitatiuſ, omni homine Majus,</hi> 'Tis à learning more known and reſolved in mans mind than all other learning, greater then man is, and therfore à certain truth ſetled in all by the Author of nature, God himſelf. Now that many err in the truth of<note place="margin">The cauſe of Miſtaking true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> Religion, proceeds without doubt too often from want of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: ſometimes from pride, ignorance, or Malice in the Teacher, which is the deplorable caſe of condemned Hereticks: Sometimes, and this is moſt uſual, it comes from an obdurance of heart begot, by à cuſtome of ſinning and tranſgreſſing againſt the very light of nature. For, this cuſtome bring's à punishment with it, that it darken's the mind notoriouſly, and makes reaſon à ſtranger not only to weighty rational motives which forceably draw us to good, but more over it ſo ſtupifies, ſo dulls and indiſpoſeth à ſoul, that the impreſſions of grace (not wanting to the moſt barbarous) touch, as it were, on flintly rocks, and produce either â weak barren fruit, or rather no penitential fruit at all. Would therfore the moſt obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Scythians, or any other uncivilized People yeild to the ordinary grace allowed them for the avoiding of ſin, known contrary to nature: God who illuminates every man in the world, would give more light, until they came to the knowledge of truths neceſſary, <hi>neceſsitate medij,</hi> to attain ſaluation. For this is an undoubted Maxim of Divines. God is not wanting in neceſſaries, and, <hi>Facienti quod in ſe eſt non denegat gratiam.</hi> He denies not grace to ſuch as endeavour by the ordinary means afforded them to avoid ſin contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but if careles of that duty which nature obliges to, they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily plunge themſelves into an Abiſs of horrid tranſgreſſions, the obdurance now mentioned followes: The powerful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace lies ſtifled, and much deaded in ſuch hardned hearts,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102688:22"/> and Conſequently ſenſe and love of pleaſures bear greateſt ſway there, which makes reaſon à ſtranger to Gods truths, and from hence groſſ errors concerning Religion take their riſe and have their origen. The objection above, purely fallacious, ſuppoſeth thoſe different Pretenders to true Religion to be all of equal Authority, and caſteth mans weak and erring reaſon on too long and laborious à work. True Religion is known with leſſe Adoe, then theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries Imagin, as we shal shew hereafter, and ſolve the objection in its due place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I argue 2. from the aſſumed principle. <hi>God exiſt's Therefore true Religion is,</hi> and diſcourſe thus. There are and ever have been ſeveral Religions profeſſed in the world, and all are not falſe, for if all were falſe, God, whoſe exiſtence we now ſuppoſe, would ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe not at all adored in ſpirit and truth, but rather Univerſally ſcorned by an erroneous worship, as if men had been created for this end to mock and abuſe their Creator; And this ſeem's contrary to the light of reaſon. Now further. All Religions are not falſe,<note place="margin">From falſe Religions, one only true, is proved.</note> 
                  <hi>ergo,</hi> one onely is true, becauſe two or more which hold Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions can not be true; and if one be true, every rational creature is obliged to follow that when 'tis clearly propoſed, and to worship his maker by à right way of Homage: but this obligation muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the truth of Religion in being, becauſe no one can be obliged to embrace à foolery, or to worship God by à meer nothing. You will ſay, one may be bound to follow an errour or an erroneous Conſcience, therefore the proof taken from this obligation, evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not the actual truth of Religion. Anſw. When we are bound to follow an errour in à matter of chieſe Concern, the Contrary truth, which all should aſſent to, ſo really is, that we may be unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled, and ſet right; but if all Religions are falſe, there is none true <hi>ſuppoſable,</hi> and Conſequently the Univerſal errour of all is à remedileſſe evil. If therefore God requires à true exhibition of worship from his Creatures He cannot permit all to err Univerſally, and for this reaſon true Religion is in being. You may reply. God is independent of us all, and need's not our Homage, or adoration. Very true, but man depend's upon God, and by the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102688:22"/> inſtinct of nature, is obliged to adore him in truth, which inſtinct as we shall prove preſently, originally proceed's from the Author of nature, and therefore God alſo obliges all to pay him the true tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of praiſe and no Counterfeit worship. Some Perhaps, may object. Religion ſeem's not Capable of à demonſtration, becauſe that which is true <hi>de facto</hi> depend's on God's free Revelation, the Credibility where of can be evidenced, but not the truth. I anſwer, in the general aſſertion already made, we abſtract from the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proofs relating to true Religion; we treate with all, who own à Deity, and ſay, theſe (if God had not elevated man to ſupernatural, beatitude, or, omitted to reveal the ſublime myſteries, of faith) had, in that State been obliged to adore theyr Creator with no falſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and thus much reaſon evinces, although we cannot (as the objection proves) ſtrici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly demonſtrate the truth of Chriſtianity, but only its Credibility, whereof more, and very amply, hereafter. In the mean while</p>
               <p n="5">5. Methinks I hear ſome, who ſtand much for reaſon, ſay, that Atheiſts (rational men) oppoſe all Religion, and why may not their Plea be heard in ſo weighty à matter? Anſw. Its not my intention<note place="margin">Atheiſm proved moſt unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> at preſent to combate too long with Atheiſts, they are utterley overthrown by the learned Arguments of innumerable grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors I have other Adverſaries to treat with: However, becauſe their pretence is reaſon, obſerve, how they deſtroy not only Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but reaſon alſo, yea, and extuinguish the very light of nature with it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ground of Atheiſm is this prodigious accurſed Principle. <hi>There is no God,</hi> no <hi>ſupreme Power,</hi> no <hi>Numen,</hi> no <hi>Providence</hi> (for<note place="margin">The accurſed Principle of Atheiſm.</note> acknowledge à God and Providence, reaſon evidently concludes, He is to be adored <hi>in ſpirit and truth,</hi> and this worship or Adoration we call Religion.) This Aſſertion then, <hi>God is not,</hi> is à prime truth, or the firſt verity with Atheiſts, wheron all their human actions depend, by this ſuppoſed verity they are regulated during their mortal liſe. Contrariwiſe, This Aſſertion. <hi>God is an eternal Being by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> is à prime Loud falshood with them, to be ſcorned by every one. Hence I argue. That firſt ſuppoſed verity. <hi>God is not,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102688:23"/> the will, extinguiſeth the light of nature, makes men exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable, enormouſly wicked, impious, ſacrilegious, takes of all fear of future punishment and hope of reward, For if there be no God, or no ſupreme power to punish hainous offences, the moſt hideous ſins imaginable would ceaſe to be pernicious, and conſequently every one might without check or torment of Conſcience, if it ſerved his ends, kill and deſtroy all he meets with. No wrong, no open injuſtice, no Treaſon, no rebellion, can be invented ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, but may be done without reproof of Conſcience, if this Principle hath influence upon what we act. <hi>God who can neither punish, or reward, is not in Being.</hi> And thus you ſee, how that firſt<note place="margin">Atheiſm deſtroyes the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> Arch-truth of Atheiſts. <hi>God is not,</hi> horridly depraves and vitiates the will, makes it ſavage, and brutish, which <hi>ex terminis</hi> is evidently fals, <hi>for Truth conſidered as truth,</hi> is à perfection of the underſtanding, and cannot <hi>per ſe</hi> pervert nature, or wreſt the will in man to all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. On the other ſide you ſee, that this Arch-falſity of Atheiſts. <hi>God is an Eternal Being,</hi> by its own force and light rectifies nature, makes men upright, juſt, obedient, ſubmiſſive to lawes and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is impoſſible; for ſuch à grand errour ſetled in mans intellectual faculty, is by it ſelf as wholly unmeet conſtantly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch laudable effects, as Truth is to deceive, or cold water to warm us. You ſee. 3. that unleſſe villany and wickednes be deemed wiſdom, and virtue and juſtice be accounted of as madneſſe, Atheiſts muſt change the Propoſitions and ſay: <hi>God is, remains à ſupreme Truth. God is not:</hi> is à ſupreme errour, and withall Conclude, that the firſt intellectual Truth cannot make men wicked, nor the firſt errour make them virtuous.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Some perhaps will reply againſt our firſt inference. Nature it ſelf abhorres the impieties now mentioned, (and that's the Atheiſts Rule) although God were not in Being. I anſwer. Nature doth ſo<note place="margin">Nature has her impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from God. wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout God, no truth can be-known.</note> now, becauſe it receives thoſe impreſſions from God, the Author of Grace and nature, but deſtroy this firſt Author, <hi>Eo ipſo,</hi> you abolish thoſe very firſt lights of nature, and make it ſtupidly brutish. The reaſon hereof à <hi>Priori</hi> is moſt convincing. Nature is endowed with theſe firſt lights, becauſe it receives them from an indefectible,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102688:23"/> and unerring intellectual <hi>Being,</hi> for if this firſt <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> which gives exiſtence and light to nature, could err, or be deceived in ſuch univerſal Notions, nature which takes its Being from this firſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual power, would loſe thoſe communicated lights, and fall to nothing. For example. Here is à participated light, or à Truth common to all rational men. <hi>Do as you would be done by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and nature univerſally approves it. I ask why is this à ſuppoſed Truth? You anſwer becauſe all agree in it. Be it ſo. But I ſay, if all thoſe who agree in it, receive the light from à power that is defective, ignorant, orliable to errour, this very conſent of nature like that firſt erring Principle, cannot but be defective, and ignorant, becauſe no effect exceed's the virtue or perfection of the cauſe it comes from.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Will you ſee this clearly? Suppoſe that à Caſual meeting or concourſe of Atomes made man rational, as Atheiſts will have it, and indued him with the Truth now mentioned, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of à ſupreme intellectual Power. This rational thing called<note place="margin">Dull Atomes impart not knowledge to any.</note> man, judges, diſcourſes, defines, and delivers, as he thinks, certainly the firſt natural verities. Very good. But we inquire further, and Ask from what cauſe he had this power of judging, and defining truly? For, if he received it from one that's dull, ignorant or deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all he judges, and defines, He cannot but participate of the nature of that firſt Principle, which is dull and ignorant. Thus much is clear. For if I receive my knowledge from one who is diſtracted mad, or falſe in his conceptions, and regulate my ſelf or others by ſuch à communicated light, all I know or teach by virtue of that knowledge, tranſcends not the nature of that Principle which is now ſuppoſed, ignorant, erroneous and deceiptful.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Summon therfore all the Atomes together which made man rational, and imprinted on him the firſt lights of nature, I demand of thoſe Atomes, could they Anſwer, How it came to paſſe, that à company of Dull inſenſible things, void of reaſon and diſcours could by meer chance, produce man intellectual, and not only intellectual, but unerrable alſo in ſome Principles called natural? I ſay all that this man judges is falſe, becauſe the Principle which gave him being, (void of light and underſtanding) cannot indue him with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102688:24"/> unerrable Truths. For, <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet;</hi> No cauſe gives<note place="margin">The reaſon why none can judge truely, if God exiſt not.</note> to its effects, what it precontains not. Inſenſible Atomes therfore, cannot make man ſenſible, nor irrational Atomes, reaſonable, nor ſtupid Atomes, devoid of truth imbue him with the firſt true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Therefore man is no more to be believed in theſe firſt lights of nature, than if Apes or Parots should ſpeak them, becauſe, as we now ſuppoſe, they proceed not originally from any intellectual Power, but only from meer duſt or inſenſible things, void of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The Sceptiks therfore erred not, when upon the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition<note place="margin">The Sceptiks erred not upon one falſe ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that God made not man, they concluded: we know nothing, we judge of nothing truly, but what might be excepted againſt, and rationally oppoſed. If therfore nature err's not in theſe firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, now acknowledged true and rational, aſcribe it to nature, but leave not of there, but ſay theſe lights come from God the Author of nature, who neither will, nor can deceive us. Here then is our grand Principle. <hi>God and nature cannot err,</hi> therfore the verity and certainty of theſe firſt known truths depending on God and nature, are free from errour. And</p>
               <p n="10">10. Hence we have an other clear demonſtration againſt Atheiſts. Either God indowed man with reaſon and theſe firſt lights of nature, or all of us, even Atheiſts may be juſtly deemed mad, and beſotted<note place="margin">An other demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Atheiſts.</note> with fooleries, but all (including Atheiſts) are not mad, nor erring in theſe firſt lights of nature, <hi>Ergo</hi> God indued man with thoſe firſt lights. I prove the Major. It is perfect madnes in the judicative power of man to deny the truth of thoſe firſt lights, but the truth of them muſt bee denyed, in caſe we receive our judicative faculty from à Power inferiour to God, for, if we receive it not from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Being, we have it from ſome inferiour erring cauſe, which may deceive. (Atomes for example) but neither atomes nor any inferiour fallible Power, can tranfuſe into us à certainty of not erring in thoſe firſt lights. The reaſon is given. The lights we have, goe not beyond the perfection of that cauſe which imparts them to nature; This cauſe, what ever it be is inferiour to God, and therfore cannot but be liable to errour, and may deceive us. Obſerve this diſcourſe well, for it is the ground à <hi>Priori,</hi> of the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, wherof more hereafter.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:102688:24"/>11 You haue other arguments moſt concluding againſt Atheiſts, but I cannot inſiſt on all. Here is one and a<note place="margin">A ſpeculatiue Argument.</note> ſpeculation of a great Diuine. A Being exiſting by it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly perfect, or without mixture of imperfection, is <hi>ex conceptu ſuo formali,</hi> or, Apprehended vnder <hi>that Notion</hi> no chimaera, nor impoſſible Obiect (as impoſſible obiects are diſtinguished from poſſibilities) therfore it is poſſible. I proue it. All Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras or Impoſſibilities eſſentially imply imperfection, becauſe they cannot be, and conſequently vpon that account want perfection, but this infinite Being conceiued by man wants no perfection (I <hi>ſay conceiued,</hi> for I neither yet proue nor ſuppoſe any thing, but only ſpeak of an obiect thus repreſented to an vnderſtanding, and ſay that obiect is no impoſſibility becauſe infinitly perfect, without appearance of flaw or imperfection.) Now further; if ſuch an obiect <hi>ex terminis</hi> be poſſible, <hi>and not impoſsible,</hi> it is of neceſſity actually exiſting, for if it haue not an actual Being, it wants per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and requires à more perfect cauſe to produce it, which is contrary to the nature of that which I conceiue, and form in my vnderſtanding; But if it be actually in Being, I haue all I ſeek for. <hi>Ens actu exiſtens,</hi> an actual exiſtency without any ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour cauſe, infinitly wiſe, without blemish or imperfection, and this we <hi>call God,</hi> the Origen of all things, Creator of Heauen and earth. But I waue theſe ſpeculations, moral arguments without them haue weight enough, and could we ſay no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<note place="margin">Moral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in-this matter ſway moſt.</note> but thus much only; That Atheiſts in à matter of Eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation (the weightieſt point imaginable) deliberatly embrace that Doctrin which can neuer do them good, <hi>If true;</hi> and eternally damn them, if <hi>fals;</hi> it were enough. Obſerue well. Were Atheiſm true, the Profeſſors of it dye like doggs, and ſo do all others with them, theſe men therfore will not hereafter laugh at Belieuers for adoring. à Deity; but if their Doctrin proues fals in the other life, all true Chriſtians may ſcorn their impudency, or rather deplore their eternal miſery which will follow, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the account of Atheiſm, but for other enormous ſins committed againſt God and nature. Now if the Atheiſt ſaies he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102688:25"/> followed the Dictate of his reaſon, this (were it ſo) at moſt excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him from the ſin of Atheiſm, but frees him not from damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if guilty of other criems againſt the light of Nature. If he ſay again, he fully enioyes his pleaſures in this life, whilſt thoſe who belieue à God, liue in reſtraint and fear. He pleads<note place="margin">Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in this life ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then Atheiſts.</note> Non-ſenſe, for à good Chriſtian, if we exclude ſome horrid ſins which nature ex ecrat's, may haue his dignities in à com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, his lawful pleaſures, and recreations as much as any Atheiſt; herein he hath no preheminence before others, no nor ſo much content as is allowed good Chriſtians; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on all accounts he is in à worſe condition them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, for he liues contemned here the whole world ouer, and can expect no happines hereafter.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Others argue and methinks very ſolidly. Though Gods exiſtence were not demonſtrable, Atheiſts may neuer the leſſ be not only conuicted of error, but iuſtly alſo look't on as in à damnable ſtate, vpon the account of their Atheiſm. Here is my reaſon. The very rules of nature and ciuility oblige vs to reſpect all according to the <hi>outward appearances</hi> of their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and condition, when we haue no iuſt reaſons which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them ſuſpected. It would be open iniuſtice to treat any<note place="margin">Atheiſts conuicted of errors though à Deity were not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable.</note> one, either in language or actions like an inferiour fellow, whoſe traine or garbe ſpeak's him à Prince, or nobleman. I should certainly err in iuſtice and morallity, should I deny any one that reſpect which the Common reputation of his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and accomplishments, hath gained him (though perhaps not deſerued) whem I haue no Conuincing proofs, that he is not what he ſeem's. There is no Atheiſt of them all, but would think him ſelf highly iniured were he ſlighted in this nature, and with good reaſon too, for the meer poſſibility of being deceiu'd in à mans quality or virtues, can be no ſufficient warrant for any to deny him that honour, which his virtues in all <hi>appearance</hi> challenge as his due.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I ſay therfore, were the Deity ſuppoſed indemonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that cannot excuſe the Atheiſt from performing thoſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102688:25"/> duties which ſuch à Being, in <hi>all appearance,</hi> moſt infinite wiſe, and omnipotent may challenge, of praiſe and Adoration, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his worth: For, if the Atheiſt exact's all punctilios of reſpect from others, which the exteriour garbe of his dignity may intitle him to, he cannot without the higheſt wrong, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the law of nature (<hi>Doe as you would be done by</hi>) deny to God, after ſo many ſignal appearances of his dignity, the due reſpect and honour, wherunto that ſupreme excellence moſt iuſtly laies claime.<note place="margin">Wherin the excellence of God appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar's.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Now if you make inquiry after the appearances of that ſupereminent excellence in à Deity, they farr ſurpaſſe all thoſe other appearances which can poſſibly concurr to create in any an opinion of mans greatnes, virtues, or accomplishments. No Monarch, no Prince, no Potentate, no nobleman can giue ſo many euident ſignes of worth and excellence (duely laid claime to) as God euidences of an infinite greater ſupereminent worth, due and proper to himſelf. Euery one knowes, that wiſdom, power, and worthy actions, enoble man; and beget in all à vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal fame of excellence. What think ye? Doth not the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the continual preſeruation, and admirable Oëconomie of this viſible world loudly ſpeak the wiſdom, power, and noble works of à Deity? Do not theſe raiſe in all à vniuerſal fame of his Being? Haue not all ciuilized nations (agreeing in the truth) the very beſt of philoſophers in paſt ages, and all Chriſtians (the moſt wiſe and learned body of men which the world euer yet ſaw) purchaſed to God, vpon euident appearances, more immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal honour and renown, than euer Prince or Monarch gained ſuitable to his ſtate and dignity? If therfore to deny à Prince to be what he ſeem's, when all imaginable appearances ſpeak him Prince, be moſt iuſtly deemed à crying iniury contrary to the light of nature; much more to deny God his Being is à greater wrong, when all the teſtimonies of grace and nature proclaim him God. One word more and I end this point. So many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and ſignal miracles both before and after our Sauiours comming, which could proceed from no other cauſe but God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102688:26"/> euidently demonſtrate his Being (as we shall ſeepreſently) or make the truth ſo apparantly credible, that, tis à degree of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to deny it. The Atheiſt therfore, who without proof or principle denies God, and depriues him of that reſpect which ought to be paid vpon outward ſigns and euident appearances of his excellence, impiously oppoſes right reaſon, and ſin's damnably; Nor can the ſuppoſed <hi>indemonstrability</hi> of God, more excuſe him from damnable irreligion, then the <hi>poſsibility</hi> of being deceiued in any mans worth or accomplish'd virtues (whem apparent ſignes make them euident) from wrong and open iniuſtice, as is now ſaid.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Laſtly the Atheiſt who pretend's to belieue nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieues (it's true differently) as much, yea and as hard things, as any Chriſtian doth. The Chriſtian belieues à God he neuer ſaw,<note place="margin">The Atheiſts belieue differently, but more difficult things then Chriſtians.</note> and the Atheiſt an infinite ſeries of cauſes, or à ſtrange concours of inuiſible Atomes he neuer ſaw. The Chriſtian belieues the ſoul he neuer ſaw to be immortal, the Atheiſt, who yet neuer ſaw ſo much, holds it vanishes into nothing. The Chriſtian ſaith an infinite wiſdom rules the world, The Atheiſt ſayes no, but either fate or chance, (as much imperceptible to ſenſe as God is) Gouerns all. You ſee therfore, how theſe men who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to belieue nothing, belieue as much as any, <hi>for we all belieue,</hi> but with this difference, that the Atheiſt imprudently iudging incredibilities belieuable faſtens on them, and leaues to Chriſtians à belief of verities not only <hi>prudently credible,</hi> but moſt true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.

               <p n="2">2. The Gentils or Heathens that adored many Gods as <hi>Mars, Iupiter, Apollo,</hi> and therfore plain Idolaters, (becauſe they make deceaſed men Gods) are now of no account in the world.

               <p n="3">3. Turkciſm which hath gained à great part of the world, and à far greater, then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euer any particular Hereſy gained, is euidently no more but an open Tyranny. The ſword, no word of God, doth all. Power, and carnal pleaſures, which corrupted nature eaſily embraceth, vphold this Religion. More cruelty followes the Profeſſors of it, then Iuſtice, fidelity, or any moral virtue; yet moral virtue, grounded in nature, euer accompanies
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102688:27"/> true Religion. Again, and here is à Demonſtration againſt Turkeiſm. Mahomet (who held himſelf à Prophet only, and no God) appeared ſome centuries after Chriſt, yea and owned both<note place="margin">A demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration againſt Turkeiſm</note> Chriſt, and Moyſes to haue been great Prophets, ſent from God. Hence I argue. If ſent from God; the Doctrin they deliuered was true. Therfore Mahomets Alcoran is falſe, which contradict's not only Chriſts Doctrin, but that alſo of Moſes and the Prophets. The contradiction is euident by the Alcoran: and the inference, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Alcoran contradict's God himſelf, ſpeaking truth by theſe Prophets, is as clear. Therfore either God contradict's him ſelf, ſaying one thing by theſe Prophets, and reuoking it by Mahomet, (which is impoſſible) or Mahomet is à lyar. Yet more. Let Mahomet iudge as he pleaſeth of Chriſt and the Prophets, He and his, are obliged to ſatisfy one Demand: viz. What Doctrin that was, wherby men were ſaued, before his preaching? And I ſpeak of Doctrin, not of Ceremonies or temporal poſitiue Lawes. He will not ſay, all from Adam to his dayes were damned for want of true Doctrin, nor can he haue recours to the Multiplicity of Gods owned by Heathens, theſe He reiects: Therfore he muſt acknowledge true Doctrin taught before his being in the world, but this Doctrin, Moſes, Chriſt, and the Prophets truely deliuered, or there was none taught in the world, This ſaued ſouls anciently, therfore, if belieued, it ſaues them ſtill; once it was true; therfore it is now and will be euer ſo, But Mahomet oppoſeth him ſelf to this true reuealed Doctrin, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He oppoſeth God ſpeaking by theſe Oracles. Hence I argue.<note place="margin">Mahomets errour Very late, oppoſite to ancient truth.</note> A Religion which began fifty ages after truth was taught in the world, and expreſly contradict's that taught truth, is falſe; Mahomets Religion is euidently ſuch, ergo it is falſe. I ſay that contradict's the ancient true Doctrin, to preuent an obiection which may ariſe out of ignorance. For ſome may ſay: Chriſt our Lord long after Moſes and the Prophets, deliuered Doctrin contrary to them, therfore the Argument againſt Mahomet conuinceth not. I anſwer; It is one thing to reueal Truth à new not anciently belieued, and an other to abrogate ancient receiued verities. Chriſt, beſides
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102688:27"/> cancelling the Ceremonial law deliuered more truths, then were explicitly declared by the Prophets, but neuer contradicted any Doctrin proceeding from God, by the mouth of his Prophets, as Mahomet did. Hence S. Auſtin and other Fathers Affirm, that Chriſts Church reuerences the Doctrin of Moſes and the Prophets, and that faith hath euer been the ſame from the beginning of the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Iewes who make their Religion moſt ancient, are notwithſtanding clearly conuinced of errour, and here is my firſt<note place="margin">The Iewes à diſperſed People with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eſſence or form of Religion.</note> Argument. A People diſperſed vp and down the world, that haue had now for 16. ages neither <hi>Eſſence</hi> nor <hi>Form of true Religion,</hi> nor the effects or fruits of it, cannot profeſſ true Religion, and conſequently are not the lawful heires of the Prophets ancient Faith. But the Iewes are thus euidently diſperſed, and want the Eſſence, the Form, and effects of Religion, Ergo. I proue the Minor. A ſacrifice eſſential to Religion which could not, according to their law, be offered but in Hieruſalem only: A Temple and Prieſts alſo euidently fail them (for no Sacrifice no Prieſt) Iudges, Prophets and miracles, cogniſances alſo of true Religion, which neuer failed in their greateſt Captiuities, now by the iuſt iudgement of God leaue them, therfore the very Form and order of Religion wholy reuerſed, manifeſt this people, once, <hi>Populum iam non populum,</hi> heretofore bleſſed, now accurſed for their obſtinacy. And if we ſpeak of other effects, or fruits of Religion, their Thalmudick Fables, their vnſatiable auarice, their cheating and Cozening others, their open Hypocricy (for gain They exteriourly profeſſ any Religion) now Catholicks, now Proteſtants, now Arians, or what you will. Theſe effects I ſay, demonſtrate à want of the very Soul, of the life of virtue, and Religion in them: All which is manifeſt to our eyes and ſenſes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To add force to this moſt weighty Argument. S. Cyprian chiefly in his firſt book <hi>Aduerſ.

Thoſe hearts are ſtupid, and eyes blind, that perceiue not the Iewish ſynogogue vtterly abandoned. Yet more. If you will ſee this Chriſtian verity amply laid forth, read the 9. chapter of Daniel, where the Holy Prophet after à large declaration of the Peoples<note place="margin">the prophet Daniels prediction.</note> iniquities and à iuſt affliction laid on them for their Sins, an Angel told him that Chriſt should come, and be ſlain, and v. 26. that thoſe were not to be his People, who would deny him. verſe 27. He fortold the ceaſing of their ſacrifice, and v. 24. denotes 4. things: Forgiueneſſe of ſins, infuſion of Iuſtice, fulfilling of Propheſies, and the annointing of the Holy of Holies: All which particulars litterally and moſt exactly agree to our Sauiour, and to him only. Thus the Prophet Daniel. But that which I would haue euery one to ponder is the prediction of Chriſt our Lord Matth. 21. in the parable of the vineyeard, where ſpeaking to the chief Prieſts and Phariſies, he clearly propheſied of their ruin and reiection before it happened. <hi>A certain housholder, ſaith the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The parable of the vineyard.</note> 
                  <hi>Goſpel, planted à vineyard</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>let it out to husbandmen, when the time of fruits drew nigh, he ſent his ſeruants to receiue the fruits.</hi> Thoſe husbandmen ſeaſed vpon the Seruants, Beat one, killed an other
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102688:28"/> and ſtoned à third. Here our Sauiour clearly alludes to the ſlain and ſtoned Prophets. Again this Housholder ſent forth other ſeruants more then the former, who were treated in like manner. Laſtly he ſent his own Son to them, ſaying, they will reuerence my Son, but, ſaith the Text, They apprehended him alſo, caſt him out of the vineyard and killed him, and thus the Iewes abuſed and maſſacred Chriſt our Lord. Next our Sauiour propoſeth this queſtion to the elders amongſt them. <hi>When therfore the Lord of the Vineyard shall come, what will he do to theſe huſbandmen?</hi> They anſwer. <hi>Malos malè perdet.</hi> He will bring theſe naughty men to naught, and let his vineyard out to other husbandmen, that shall render him fruit in due ſeaſon. Now followes the very life and ſoul of the<note place="margin">The force of that parable.</note> whole parable. <hi>Ieſus ſaid to them, haue you not read in Scripture, the stone which the builders reiected, the ſame is made into the head of the corner? This is done by our Lord, and it is merueilous in our eyes; Ideo dico vobis, Therfore I ſay to you: The Kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be giuen to à nation, yeilding the fruits therof.</hi> &amp;c. The Chief Prieſts and Phariſies, ſaith the Goſpel, knew he meant them. The kingdome therfore wherof our B: Lord ſpake, and fortold should be giuen to an other, appear's manifeſtly Gods own glorious work, laid open to our eyes and ſenſes in the Chriſtian Catholick Church.</p>

Where greater ſignes and miracles, which cannot but proceed from God, euidence Religion, there is true Religion. But moſt vndeniably, Chriſt shewed greater ſignes and miracles at the founding of his Kindom, then either Moſes or the Prophets manifeſted, therfore he taught true Religion, and by virtue of thoſe wonders reuerſed Iudaiſm, and made it improbable. I ſay <hi>greater</hi> and mark wel my Reaſon. Had not Chriſts illuſtrious works moſt eminently ſurpaſſed thoſe of Moſes and the Prophets, but been as it were equal with them, Chriſt's glorious Kingdom could neuer haue come to ſo mighty à growth, to ſo vaſt an extent as now it is,<note place="margin">The reaſon of our ſauiours Large extended Kingdom.</note> it could not haue wrought ſuch ſtrange conuerſions as we ſee it done, the whole world ouer. why? A leſſer or equal Euidence for Truth can no more obſcure or leſſen an other greater or equal Euidence, then one candle darken on other, (as we ſee the light of the ſun doth.) Therfore that euidence which made the Synogogue
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102688:29"/> credible to the Iewes, was to be taken away with a far greater light of manifeſt ſignes and wonders, shewed to Chriſtians. For If we ſuppoſe the Euidence equal in both caſes (ſeing no Religion is manifeſtly true of it ſelf without antecedent motiues) we might all yet as ſecurely profeſſ Iudaiſm, as Chriſtianity, and Therfore our Bleſſed Lord ſpake à moſt profound Point of Doctrin, when he ſaid. <hi>Had he not wrought greater wonders amongſt them, then euer any did, they would haue been excuſable and without ſin,</hi> which Doctrin implies this great verity, that true Religion where euer it is, pleads moſt powerfully for it ſelf, yea dead's and vanquishes errour by à moſt clear Euidence of glorious works, and Miracles.

               <argument>
                  <p>Chriſtianity as it ſtands in oppoſition to Iewes, Turks, Infidels and Heretickes, is the only true Religion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe Aſſertion is an euident Inference out of the former diſcours, for if true Religion be in the world, and not found amongſt Heathens, Turks, or Iewes, Thoſe only called Chriſtians enioy that bleſſing, or there is no Religion at all in being. Though the Propoſition ſtand's firm on this ſole proof, yet 'Ile ſtrengthen it with two Conuincing Arguments. The<note place="margin">The firſt Argument.</note> firſt. Where we euidently find the marks. cogniſances, and ſignes of true Religion, there it is, but Chriſts Doctrin only which we call Chriſtianity is vndeniably manifeſted by clear ſignes and cogniſances of truth, and therfore is the true Religion. I proue the Minor. A cauſe is beſt known by its effects, the tree by its fruits, the ſun by its light, Faith by its works, and the Exiſtence of God by the emanation of his creatures. But no other Religion whether it be that of Iewes, Turks or Heathens euer shewed to the world the like effects of Truth, the like glorious Miracles, the like auſterity of life, the like contempt of tranſitory Goods, the like efficacy of Doctrin, or, brought ſo many Infidels from incredulity, ſo many from ſenſuallity to à holy virtuous life, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles gained ſoon after the firſt promulgation of the Goſpel: Therfore theſe moſt illuſtrious marks and cogniſances of Chriſtianity, as clearly conuince that God deliuered truth by the Preaching of our bleſſed Lord, and his Elect Apoſtles, as any effect in nature demonſtrat's the cauſe it comes from. The Marks are manifeſt to our eyes and ſenſes, and plead moſt powerfully for our Chriſtian Doctrin. No other ſect falſly called Religion, has euidenced the like ſignes, and this, I am ſure no Chriſtian can deny.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:102688:31"/>2. A ſecond argument is ſo weighty, in the behalfe of Chriſts ſacred Doctrin, that though we had no knowledge of God or Prouidence vpon other Principles, that which I am now to propoſe, would make both moſt vndoubted. I argue therfore. That<note place="margin">An Other taken from the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtian Religion.</note> Religion whoſe Author, Founder, and chief Preſeruer is God (we here ſuppoſe with Iewes and Turks the actual exiſtence of à Deity) is manifeſtly the true Religion, for God cannot found or teach falshood, but Chriſtian Religion, as taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, had and has God for its Author, Founder, and Preſeruer, therfore it is the only true Religion. I proue the Minor. A Religion drawn into à law of liuing holily, which Miraculouſly began, and was ſpred the whole world ouer, aboue the power and force of nature, is manifeſtly from God, and ſubſiſt's by Diuine virtue only, (Diuels neuer help't in ſo pious à work) but our Holy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, was and is ſtill thus miraculously ſpred and preſerued alſo, all Nations ouer, aboue the power and force of nature, therfore it is from God, and ſubſiſts by his Diuine virtue. To proue that it began miraculously, and was propagated aboue the power and<note place="margin">Four things Conſiderable in the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel.</note> force of nature, we are to ponder theſe four things. 1. The ſublime Doctrin of Chriſtian Religion. 2. The condition of thoſe firſt Maſters who taught it, and in what difficult circumſtances. 3. The Quality and number of ſouls gained to belieue it. 4. By what means they were induced to Aſſent. Obſerue well: You will find in euery particular à Prodigious work aboue the force of nature, and no other but Gods powerful hand concurring with it. Thus it is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the world lay as it were in à dead ſleep of ſin and ignorance thoughtleſſe God knowes, of caſting ſo much as à thought towards Heauen, or of louing any good, but what ſenſe and corrupted nature liked of. A new Doctrin ſad to ſenſe, and mighty difficult to reaſon was heard of. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit. Humility ſcarſe heard of before, was then cryed vp for à great virtue: wrongs were to be forgiuen, lawes obeyed, iuſtice obſerued</hi> &amp;c. But was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuallity only thus Croſſed in its propenſions? No. A load of high Miſteries beſides, was laid on Reaſon alſo, which ſeemed to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102688:31"/> rack and torture it. God one in eſſence and three diſtinct perſons. <hi>God an Infant born of à virgin.</hi> A Lord Ieſus, true God and man, after à weariſome life Scourged by impious hands and finally Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. ſuch (with much more) was the ſtrange Doctrin of Chriſtianity. How euer (and here is the Miracle or prodigious work) it got ground, ſpread it ſelf far and neer, and though contrary to ſenſuallity, and aboue Reaſon, yet millions of ſouls ſo firmly belieued it, though auſtere and hard, that innumerable haue dyed for it. Now if this be not à wonder, or à prodigious work aboue the force of nature, we may well conclude with. S. Auſtin lib. 22. de Ciuit. c. 5. This to be the <hi>greateſt Miracle of all,</hi> that God conuerted the world without Miracles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The. 2. conſideration yet encreaſeth the wonder of this admirable work. We know great effects require proportionable cauſes of like ſtrength, and virtue. A weak child lift's not vp à weighty burden, nor can à mean handful of naked men defeat à puiſant Army. Ponder well the Propagation of Chriſts Goſpel, and the Conuerſions of Nations to Chriſtian Faith, viſible to our eyes, the work is without diſpute, great, noble, and glorious. But ſay by what cauſe, by what inſtruments, or Miniſters did God effect it? Did he ſend Angels from Heauen to preach a <hi>Trinity,</hi> à <hi>Crucified Sauiour,</hi> &amp;c. or force Chriſtians to à belief of thoſe <hi>Myſteries by ſtrength of arms;</hi> No. <hi>Rex noſter Pacificus,</hi> Our Diuine Ieſus is the God of peace. <hi>Non in Commotione Dominus.</hi> No tumultuous ſpirit brought in his Doctrin. Caluins tragical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the late begotten Hereſy was not heard of, when Chriſt our Lord and his Diſciples preached the Goſpel. Some perhaps will ſay that Gods great intention when he firſt laid the foundation of Religion, was to deſtroy Idolatry and to eſtablish à<note place="margin">Ty what inſtruments the Goſpel was dilated.</note> new law againſt Iudaiſm, and therfore proceeded as the world vſually doth, in weighty matters. He ſurely made choiſe of moſt <hi>expert Aduocates,</hi> of the wiſeſt <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> of the profoundeſt Iudges, and moſt eloquent Orators on earth, and by theſe pleaded for Chriſtianity. 'Tis an errour, all was contrary: Our euer glorius God did his own work by twelue poor Fishermen, ignoble,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102688:32"/> ignorant, friendleſſe and deſtitute of all that the world makes account of, yea, and he shewed this power more by theſe weak Inſtruments; and their ſucceſſors in after ages, than he did before whilſt he liued with them, to manifeſt that the work was his <hi>Principally,</hi> and theirs <hi>inſtrumentally</hi> This Doctrin is ſo fully deliuered by the great Apoſtle of the Gentils, that we need not S. Chriſoſtoms Eloquent Diſcours on the ſubiect in his ſermon. <hi>Christ is God.</hi> To illuſtrate it further (though that alſo merits à ſerious reflection) <hi>I will deſtroy,</hi> ſaith S. Paul 1. Cor. 1. 19. <hi>The wiſdom of the wiſe, and reiect the prudence of the prudent</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hath not God made the wiſdom of the world foolish?</hi> for <hi>becauſe in the wiſdom of God, the world did not by wiſdom know God, it pleaſed God by the foolishnes of Preaching to ſaue them that belieue</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For that which is foolish to God, is wiſer then men, and that which is the infirm of God, is ſtronger then men. See your vocation, Bretheren, that not many wiſe according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, but the foolish things of the world, God hath choſen, that he may confound the wiſe, and the weak things of the world, that he may confound the strong; and the baſe things of the world, and the contemptible, God hath choſen, and thoſe things which are not, that he might destroie thoſe things which are, that no flesh may glory in his ſight.</hi> Which is to ſay huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne power had no hand in this glorious work, and therfore it is as manifeſtly aboue the force of nature, as if Chriſt Ieſus had ſent 12. little Children to conuert the world, for 'tis no leſſe à miracle to ſee ſo great à work done by 12. poor fishermen, then by 12. young Children.</p>
               <p n="5">5. 3. Conſider the number and quality of ſouls gained to our Chriſtian belief, and ask whether they were à few only, or of ſo flexible à temper as to credit any thing vpon hearſay. You will anſwer they were not few. Witneſſe the conuerſion of whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and if we Conſider nature, no leſſe. obſtinate than numerous. <hi>Incredulum illud genus humanum,</hi> ſaith Arnobius lib. 1. Contra Gentes. Mankind moſt ſtubborn and incredulous, contrary to its former liberty and education, ſubmitted to the yoke of Chriſt, which truth,<note place="margin">The number gained in numerable.</note> as this Author obſerues, were it not as euident as day light, would haue been thought impoſſible. Perhaps you'l ſay (though many),
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102688:32"/> they were yet ſimple and ignorant and therfore eaſily wrought on. No. A Learned Dyoniſius, à Clemens Romanus, and innumerable other great capacities, called on, came in to the Church, ſuch choiſe ones, (God cooperating with his weak inſtruments,) were drawn out of errour and darkneſſe, to the light of the Goſpel. Now if you ask in the laſt place, by what means theſe conuerſions were made? The Goſpel anſwers Mark 16. 17. <hi>By ſignes and manifeſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from Heauen. Going into the world preach the Goſpel to all creatures</hi> &amp;c. and them who belieue, theſe ſignes shall follow.

Theſe Arguments, as I now ſaid, ſo forceably euidence à power aboue nature in the eſtablishing of Chriſtianity, that if we had no other Proofs for the Exiſtence of God, theſe alone without diſpute Conuince moſt ſufficiently, the being of à Numen aboue vs, who has demonſtrated his prouidence in laying the foundation of Chriſtian Religion, ſo firmly.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I Anſwer Affirmitiuely and ſay, that the Augmentation or further growth of Chriſtian Religion, is to be eſteemed no leſſe à work of prouidence and Diuine Aſſiſtance, then its firſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102688:33"/> eſtablishment was. One reaſon is. The Doctrin preached to<note place="margin">Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty further Spread aboue the force of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> innumerable People not Chriſtian in the Apoſtles time, was the ſame ſublime learning (of à <hi>Trinity,</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and other difficult Myſteries) The ſtubborneſſe and incredulity of thoſe who heard it (at laſt induced to belieue) were alike in them, as in the firſt conuerted Chriſtians, Propenſions to ſenſuallity which they quitted, as ſtrong, and violent; The number of thoſe after gained ſouls, you may hold far more, their wiſdom not inferiour to the former, and the quality of innumerable (witnes ſo many Emperours, Kings and Princes) drawn in following ages to Chriſtianity, much exceeded thoſe firſt conuerted by the Apoſtles. Clear and manifeſt miracles (effects of Gods power only) haue been more numerous, in the Centuries ſince the Apoſtles preaching, then before. What euer therfore proues the firſt Propagation of the Goſpel miraculous, or à work aboue the ſtrength of nature, as forceably conuinceth the Truth we here plead for. Now if ſome obiect! Theſe later Preachers of the Church ſent abroad to preach Chriſts Doctrin, had much more of the humane learning, then thoſe firſt great maſters of Chriſtianity, and therfore might well by natural Eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and humane literature gain many without Diuine Aſſiſtance. I anſwer, when the Poets perſwade me that Orpheus harp and harmony tamed wild beaſts and moued ſtones, 'Ile belieue (and not Sooner) that wolues became lambs, that the ſtony hearts of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels were ſoftned, and made ſubiect to Chriſts ſacred law, by the power of humane learning only.

               <p n="2">2. You know there are two things the world ſtand's for, Pro <hi>aris &amp; focis,</hi> that is for Religion and earthly commodities. Religion, you ſee, hath the Preheminence. Imagin now, that à Heathen Prince should ſend the moſt Eloquent and learned Doctors within his Dominions vpon this hard enterpriſe, To gain à forrein Monark and People highly auerſe from him, his lawes, and comands,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102688:33"/> Withall; to abandon their old Religion and admit of à new one, without the leaſt hope of any worldly intereſt; Nay contrary, moſt aſſured to loſe much, which nature seek's after; Would ſuch à Policy (think yee) take? or could theſe Doctors though neuer ſo Eloquent haue confidence to bring about their deſigne, by wit or learning only? No. You will iudge it impoſſible to gain ſo<note place="margin">humane learning, not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert ſouls.</note> much as one ſole Prouince, when no motiue of earthly commodity enters, but much againſt it. Here is our very caſe. The Church of Chriſt in ages following the Apoſtles, ſent abroad her Miſſioners, and Theſe commiſſioned Preachers, haue not only deſtroyed Altars erected to falſe Gods, moſt obſtinatly defended by Gentils, but introduced à new ſacred Religion in place of them, mightily oppoſite to ſenſuallity and what euer the world loues: (here is the tribute payd to Chriſt) can we therfore think that wit did this work? or perſwade our ſelves, that à little breath drawn only from natural knowledge, threw down theſe Altars? No. à Diuine virtue, and that moſt Powerful did the deed, God only wrought theſe Conuerſions, no leſſe admirable, then Euident to our eyes. When S. Peter, as we read in the Goſpel Luk. 5. 4. launched forth into the deep at Chriſts command, and drew vp great Multitudes of fishes, both he and others ſtood amaſed at the Miracle: And more iuſtly may all admire the far greater multitude of men, drawn out of à gulf of ſin and ignorance then fortold, <hi>Ex hoc</hi>

If you deny, blot out thoſe words of the Goſpel, as moſt vntrue Mark 16. 20. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no cooperante</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Our Lord cooperating with them,</hi> and ſay all Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical conuerſions were wrought by natural cauſes only, And grant next, Mahometiſm and Chriſtianity thus far equal, that as Mahomet driues all to his belief, by the ſword (the cauſe is natural) ſo the Church drawes all to it by wit, policy and humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and this means is altogether as natural. Now if you ſay thoſe firſt Conuerſions were truely effects of grace, and wrought by Gods ſpecial aſſiſtance, This ſequele is Clear: The like made in after ages by the Church, far more numerous, as difficult and wholly as glorious, proceed from the ſame fountain of Goodnes, God's Diuine grace and ſpecial Aſſiſtance. And note, I ſpeak here of real Conuerſions, wrought in Belieuers vpon ſolid motiues (the Church shewes you millions of them) not of hypocritical changes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended<note place="margin">hypocritical Conuerſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not Valuable.</note> for God and Religion, when worldly intereſt has à hand in them. Theſe are as ſoon diſtringuished by their falſe luſtre, as à comet from the ſun, they laſt not long, but fall like blaſing ſtarrs. We meddle not with them. Thus much of à short digreſſion which makes way to an other <hi>querie,</hi> and 'tis as followeth.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>VVhether all called Christians Belieue intirely Chriſt's ſacred Doctrin? And whether meanes be afforded to arriue to the knowledge of true Christian Religion?</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THeſe queſtions largely handled in the other Treatiſe, are ſoon reſolued vpon certain Principles. I ſay therfore firſt. All called Chriſtians belieue not truely and intirely Chriſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102688:35"/> Sacred Doctrin, and proue it; If Hymenaeus and Alexander Timoth. 1. c. 1. 20. once true Belieuers made shipwrack of their Faith; if the Arians Monothelits, Pelagians, Donatiſts, and ſuch known Hereticks named Chriſtians, haue fallen alſo, and loſt true belief of Chriſtian verities ſufficiently propoſed? This ſequel is euident. All of them though named Chriſtians, haue not Faith intirely good, nor indeed any Diuine Faith at all. See the other Treatiſe Diſc: 3. c. 3. n. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſay. 2. All and euery one may with ordinary diligence come to the knowledge of the true Chriſtian Religion, I proue the Aſſertion. Diuine Faith, without which we cannot poſſibly<note place="margin">Means ſufficient to know true Religion.</note> pleaſe God, is determinatly neceſſary to ſaluation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Religion where true Faith is taught, is alſo neceſſary. Therefore both theſe after Ordinary diligence vſed may be known; vnleſſe we wil ſay, that God firſt makes ſuch things neceſſary to ſaluation, and then remoues them ſo far out of ſight, that none can know by prudent ordinary diligence what theſe neceſſary things are. I ſay <hi>neceſſary to ſaluation,</hi> not to diſpute with Melchior Canus and others of the neceſſity of faith to the firſt iuſtification of à Sinner. This difficulty we waue, and Argue. 2. God as we now ſuppoſe with all Chriſtians, yea with Iewes and Turks alſo, is the Author of true Religion, which he reuealed to the world, for no other end but mans happines, and eternal ſaluation, therfore if he deſires all to be ſaued by true Religion, which is the final end therof, He cannot, vnles his Prouidence fail, but afford meanes to know where it is profeſſed, otherwiſe (which ill beſeem's an infinite wiſdom) he would ſet vs all on work to gain Heauen by the belief of true Religion, and withall leaue vs ſo in darknes, that we cannot with all prudent induſtry, come to the knowledge of it; which is to ſay, He will haue vs know the end of Religion, and yet conceal the meanes leading to the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again I argue. 3. God who obliges not to impoſſibilities, laies à ſtrait command on all to belieue true Religion (and not to aſſent to any fals ſect) therfore it may be known, and clearly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102688:35"/> diſtinguished, at leaſt from the errours of infidels, Iewes, and Turks. Known I ſay, but how? Not by its internal light immediatly, for no Religion euer yet was its own ſelf-euidence <hi>ex terminis,</hi> or pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently got admittance, becauſe the Profeſſors of it Cryed it vp as true. Therfore the credibility of true Religion, which muſt be<note place="margin">True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not its own ſelfe euidence.</note> laid open to Reaſon by force of Conuincing motiues, is made as well diſcernable from Hereſy (deſtructiue of ſaluation) as from Turciſm, or Iudaiſm, yea, and may be no leſſe clearly diſcouered by its proper ſignes and luſtre than à true Miracle; for example, that of S. Peter, from Simon Magus Sorcery. This cannot be denyed, vnles God, as I now ſayd, either command's impoſſibilities, viz, to find that out, which cannot be found, or licenceth vs to embrace any Religion called Chriſtian, whether good or bad, true or fals (it imports not) becauſe the beſt, if it can be found, is no more but à meer Probability, or like vncertain opinions in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, which may be reiected or followed according to euery priuate fancy. This execrable Doctrin of the indifference to any Religion, learned in the Diuels ſchool, is now à daies much in the mouths of many, and, I fear, too deeply rooted in the hearts<note place="margin">Nor à thing indifferent.</note> of ſome later Sectaries. But of this more here after. In the mean time you may conclude. If true Religion be in the world, its made diſcernable not only from Iudaiſm but Hereſy likewiſe; and if it haue this <hi>diſcernibility</hi> it can be known, if known, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth an obligation to be belieued with Diuine Faith, if it grounds certain Faith <hi>Subiectiuely</hi> taken in him that belieues, it is no Opinion, and conſidered <hi>Obiectiuely</hi> it implies the higheſt certainty Imaginable, ſetled on God's Reuelation as is largly proued in the other Treatiſe.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of our Sectaries errour in their ſearch after true Religion. As alſo of Mr. Stillingfleets inconſequent way of Arguing.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. ONe errour common to all condemned Hereticks, is in the firſt place to find out true Religion by the book of holy Scripture alone. A moſt improbable way, as the ancient Tertullian learnedly obſerues lib de Praeſcrip. cap. 9. 15. but chiefly cap: 19. at thoſe words often cited. <hi>Ergo non ad Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>as prouocandum &amp;c.</hi> The reaſons of my Aſſertion well pondered are moſt conuincing, 1. The Sectary laies hold of à book which he ſayes teaches truth, and yet knowes not in his Principles nor shall euer know <hi>infallibly,</hi> whether the book he own's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's the Doctrin of true Religion, or ought to be valued as Gods aſſured word, which is to ſay in other terms; He learn's infallible truths of à Maſter, before he hath infallible certainty of this Maſters teaching truth, <hi>infallibly.</hi> That the Sectary wants infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſurance of his book is euident, for he ſaith, no word of God, written or vnwritten, no infallible Tradition, no infallible authority on earth, aſcertain's him of the <hi>Scriptures Diuinity.</hi> So Mr: Stillingfleet in ſeueral places chiefly part 1. c. 6. Pag 170. Therfore he, can haue no in fallible Aſſurance of the Doctrin contained in<note place="margin">Sectaries haue not infallible aſſurance of their Bible.</note> Scripture, and conſequently no Diuine Faith grounded on that Doctrin, as I shall shew hereafter. How euer, grant him an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable aſſurance in à general way of ſome books of Scripture, hee hath not yet ſo much as moral certainty of that preciſe. <hi>Canon</hi> he receiues, excluding other books which he denies as Scripture, For no Orthodox Church, no vniuerſal Tradition, no conſent of Fathers, no definition of any Council, approues his Canon, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plodes thoſe books reiected by him, therfore the ſectaries Canon,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102688:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> wherof there is ſo Much doubt, can giue no moral aſſurance of Gods reuealed verities, vnles it were without diſpute à liquid truth, that their Canon only is Gods word, which cannot be ſuppoſed, whilſt ſo learned and numerous à multitude of Chriſtians oppoſe it, as defectiue and imperfect. Yet more. Suppoſe he giues you the exact number of Canonical books, hee gain's nothing, becauſe the very Doctrin of theſe books is no more but à Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore vnleſſe the Tranſlator or Printer, haue faithfully complyed with their duty, and preſerued the books in their ancient purity, no Proteſtant can aſſure himſelf or any, that what we now read, is without change or corruption, pure in the very neceſſary points of Faith. If you ſay you compare them with the ancient Original Copies of the Hebrew and Greek; I anſwer; the very beſt Originals men can light on now, are no more but meer Tranſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and conſequently may haue been corrupted by the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber,<note place="margin">The beſt Originals now extant, are only tranſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> the Printer, or Librarian. Therefore the Sectary hath no Moral certainty of the bare letter in Scripture, if he cannot shew vs the hand writing or Autograph's of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, wherof there is no danger, becauſe he neuer ſaw any. Hence I argue. He who hath not infallible certainty of the very letter of Scripture, want's infallible <hi>certainty of the Doctrin</hi> contained in Scripture, but the Proteſtant hath no infallible certainty of the letter of Scripture, Therefore he want's infallible certainty of the Doctrin contained in Scripture: for no certainty of the letter, no<note place="margin">An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt ſectaries.</note> certainty of the Doctrin drawn from thence. But if he has not certainty of the Doctrin he can haue no infallible faith grounded on it: Therefore Scripture alone is an unmeet means to teach him, what either true Faith, or Religion is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. Stillingfleet to ſolve this vnanſwerable Argument Part. 1. c. 6. p. 196. ſaies, we beg the Queſtion, when we require an infallible Teſtimony for our belieuing the Canon of ſcripture, yet grants ſuch à certainty, as excludes <hi>all poſsibility of reaſonable doubting.</hi> and Chap. 7. p. 211. declares himſelf further thus. <hi>Giue me leaue to make this ſuppoſition, that God might not haue giuen this ſupernatural Aſsiſtance to your Church, which you pretend makes it infallible; whether
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102688:37"/> men through the vniuerſal conſent of perſons of the Chriſtian Church in all ages, might not haue been vndoubtedly certain, that the Scripture we haue was the ſame deliuered by the Apostles?</hi> I anſwer, if you take leaue to make that ſuppoſition, licence me to tell you, you haue not that certainty of Scripture which Diuine Faith both ſuppoſeth and requires. And here is one reaſon (to omit others inſiſted on here after) Deny this infallible aſſurance of the books of Scripture, you haue no greater certainty, that God endited thoſe words we now read, than you haue aſſurance that Ariſtotle wrote his Topicks, or Caeſar his Commentaries; And dare you, or any ſay, that we receiue<note place="margin">Mr. Stilling: anſwer, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory.</note> our Bible vpon no ſurer ground? Or can you Imagin, if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians accept theſe books vpon à Teſtimony leſſe then vndubitable, it may not be ſuſpected that à thouſand gross errours haue entred the Copies by the negligence, or inaduertency of ſuch as tranſcribed them? Belieue it. Were Ariſtotles Topicks matter of Diuine Faith, none would dy after the fallible conueyance of them to our age, vpon this perſwaſion; that nothing ſubſtantially firſt writ by that Author, hath been changed or altered Since; and the ſame I aſſert of the Bible; vnleſſe you ſay that the words of Scripture were writ in ſome celeſtial and incorruptible Matter, yet to be read by all, or grant, which is truth; that as God by ſpecial Prouidence cauſed them to be writ pure, ſo alſo he yet preſerues them without blemish, and now witneſſeth the truth by the Teſtimony of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Church, wherof more largely hereafter. At preſent I will only anſwer your difficulty about that fallible certainty, which you affirm, excludes <hi>all poſsibility of reaſonable doubting,</hi> and ſay firſt. The vniuerſal conſent of perſons of the Chriſtian Church in all ages, neuer approued the intire Canon of your Scripture: for not only the preſent Roman Catholick Church, but the ancient councils alſo, receiued books which you reiect. This truth is ſo manifeſt that it need's no further proof, therefore your Canon want's the approbation of the whole Chriſtian world, and conſequently you haue not ſo high à certainty of Scripture, as excludes all <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of reaſonable doubting.</hi> I anſwer. 2. And it is à demonſtration againſt Proteſtants, who ſay the whole Chriſtian world for à thouſand
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102688:37"/> years at leaſt, erred in Doctrin contrary to the verities of Holy Scriptures, for, if we goe up from Luther to the 4<hi rend="sup">.th</hi> or 5<hi rend="sup">.th</hi> age after Chriſt, you'l find none but condemned erring Hereticks and Roman Catholiks, no leſſe actually guilty (ſay Sectaries) of theſe profeſſed errours: <hi>Of praying to Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <note place="margin">A further Argument, taken from the papiſts ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed errours</note> 
                  <hi>real preſence</hi> &amp;c. Thus much ſuppoſed; I both anſwer and Argue againſt you. If the whole Chriſtian world was for that vaſt time ſo ſtrangely infatuated, as to mantain errours contrary to Scripture, when the true Doctrin therof no leſſe concerned their eternal Saluation, then the true letter; it cannot poſſibly be ſuppoſed vpon any weak Probability (much leſſe on ſuch à certainty as excludes all reaſonable doubt) that theſe beſotted Chriſtians preſerued the letter of Scripture pure and intire, whoſe errours are now imagined moſt groſſ againſt the Doctrin contained in God's word. Obſerue my reaſon. It is much more eaſy to conceiue (if all held corrupted Doctrin) that the very letter of Scrtpture was by negligence or ignorance of theſe Corrupters of Doctrin, alſo corrupted, then to imagin the records preſerued pure, and Millions of Chriſtians to read them, and after the reading, groſly to miſtake Gods verities regiſtred in that book. And here I muſt mind M. Stillingfleet of his proofleſſ and inconſequent way in Arguing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You Sr. ſay firſt. The whole erring multitudes of Chriſtians before Luther preſerued Scripture pure, yet forſooth, theſe ſilly men taught one Doctrin after an other, contrary to Scripture. They peruſed the book interpreted it, yea preached it, to their own confuſion, and condemnation. You ſay. 2. It is not poſſible that<note place="margin">Mr. ſtilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleets argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments retorted</note> theſe writings could be extorted out of mens hands by fraud or violence vnder their eyes, or ſuffered to be loſt by negligence: Yet you make it not only poſſible, but grant the Doctrin therof to haue been loſt and peruerted by fraud, negligence, violence, or all together. You ſay. 3. Theſe ancient Chriſtians were profeſſed enemies to the corrupters of the Bible: yet you hold them dear friends to the deprauers of Gods verities, regiſtred in the Bible. You ſay. 4. The intereſt of eternal Saluation made theſe Chriſtians careful to preſerue the Bible in its firſt integrity: And yet you make
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102688:38"/> them ſupinly careles in preſeruing the verities contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as highly neceſſary to ſaluation. You ſay. 5. The eternal concerns of all Chriſtians ſo depended vpon the ſafe preſeruation of theſe Sacred Records that if they were not true, we are all moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. And I reply. The eternal concerns of all Chriſtians as highly depend's on the pure Doctrin of Scripture as on the outward ſecured Records; for what auails it to haue pure Records, and draw poyſon out of them? You grant the whole world was miſerably infatuated with falſe Doctrin for ten whole ages, though it had the letter of Scripture pure, and yet the purity of that book preuented not the miſery of miſchieuous errours. You ſay. 6. <hi>When once I ſee à whole Corporation content to burn the publick Charter, and ſubstitute à</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And further vrged againſt him.</note> 
                  <hi>new one in its place, and this not to be ſuſpected or diſcouered; When I shall ſee à Magna Charta foiſted, and neither King nor People be ſenſible of ſuch à cheat, when all the world shall conſpire to deceiue themſelues and their Children: I may then ſuſpect ſuch an impoſture as to the Scripture,</hi> but <hi>not before.</hi> Anſw. <hi>Ex ore tuo te Iudico,</hi> and retort the Argument in your own words. When. I ſee not only à whole Corporation but à whole ample learned Church, waſt or depraue the old Legacy of Chriſt ſacred Truths bequeathed to it, and a new learning ſubſtituted in its place, and this change not to be ſuſpected and diſcouered: when I shall ſee that <hi>Magnum Depoſitum</hi> of his Doctrin once committed to the Church escare to be foisted, and neither King, nor Prelate, nor People found, ſenſible of the cheat: when all the world shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to deceiue themſelues and their children by teaching fals Doctrin in place of Chriſts verities: Then I shall, and muſt in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſuſpect an impoſture, à change, an alteration in the very book of Scripture. This later you shamfully grant to haue happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when vpon the pretence of hideous errours you abandoned all other Chriſtian Societies in the world, and vnfortunatly made à Schiſm with Luther from the true Roman Catholick Church, therefore you may not only weakly ſuſpect, but muſt moſt iuſtly fear the firſt, which is, that you haue not true Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence I ſay, what euer Argument proues the book of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hitherto preſerued pure, proues likewiſe the Doctrin of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102688:38"/> preſent Church as faithfully tranſmitted and Conueyed pure from<note place="margin">An inference from what is ſayd.</note> age to age to our very dayes. Contrariwiſe, if there were any Principle (as there is none) whereby this Doctrin could be shew'd falſe or ſtained; All might (if reaſon haue place) ioyntly acknowledge à non-aſſurance of the Scriptures purity; For that<note place="margin">Corrupters of Chriſts Doctrin may more Eaſily Corrupt the words of ſcripture.</note> Church which may loſe true faith and Corrupt Chriſt's Doctrin, may more eaſily loſe or corrupt Chriſt's Scripture, vnleſſe you grant, which is horridly impious, that Gods ſpecial Prouidence had only care to keep à Bible incorrupt, and at laſt, like one careless, permitted the Doctrin of that book (wheron Saluation eſſentially depend's) to be extorted out of the hearts of all Chriſtians for à thouſand yeares together. Ponder theſe truths Mr: Stilling: and Confeſſe ingenuouſly, if your Principles hold good, you haue not ſo much as any probable certainty of your Bible.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Perhaps one may ſay if the letter of Scripture be corrupted the very foundation of Faith is shaken, but if ſuppoſed pure and vnaltered, though all Chriſtians, Papiſts, and Hereticks erred in the Doctrin therof, yet they may be reclaimed from errour by the pure Euangelical preachers, now ſwarming in England. Pittiful. what no help then for à beſotted world before theſe late men appeared, who here ſpeak at random? They firſt tell vs vpon à meer <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> without any ſemblance of proof, that Scripture was euer preſerued pure though all Chriſtians abuſed its Doctrin; wheras we contend vpon moſt grounded reaſons, that if all erred in the doctrin drawn from Scripture, the letter cannot be ſuppoſed pure, becauſe à Church careleſly negligent in the preſeruation of Chriſts Doctrin, cannot be thought careful enough in preſeruing the true Records of his Doctrin: Now the Anſwer without proof is, though all erred Doctrinally, yet none of them maimed or marred the Bible, which beſides à Moral impoſſibility, implies à pure begging of the Queſtion. See more of this particular in the other Treatiſe Diſc. 2. c. 2. n. 8. Again. If theſe Euangelical men pretend to Conuince vs of our errours<note place="margin">What ſectaries are obliged to.</note> by à pure book of Scripture, they are obliged to shew vs ſome one Copie at leaſt, wherof we may haue ſuch certainty as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102688:39"/> à <hi>Poſsibility of all doubting.</hi> But this no Proteſtant can do, who<note place="margin">If God aſſiſted the Tranſcribers of ſcripture, much more he aſſiſt's the Church.</note> reiect's all editions now extant except perhaps his own. The Vulgar latin, which Mr: Stillingfleet call's the great <hi>Diana of Rome,</hi> of high credit in the Church for à thouſand years, pleaſeth not, The <hi>Clementine</hi> and <hi>Sixtine</hi> Bibles, not different in any Material point touching Faith, are vnderualued. Set theſe aſide, I deſire Mr: Still: or any Proteſtant, to show me à Copy, whoſe Authenticalneſs is ſo agreed on by the conſent of all Chriſtians, as may exclude reaſonable doubting of its purity. It is vtterly impoſſible. If theſe men anſwer, we muſt haue recourſe to the <hi>Autograph's,</hi> or ancient <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> of the Hebrew and Greek, I deny their ſuppoſition, for theſe now extant, are no firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, in à word no more but Tranſcriptions. What greater ſecurity therefore, haue we of ſuch copies then of the Vulgar latin? vnleſſe you ſay that the Tranſcriber (who euer he was) becauſe he wrote <hi>Hebrew, Caldee,</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> could not tell à lye, or was determined to follow in euery Material point of Faith the Hagiographers Copy moſt faithfully. Grant this, and I Argue: If God by ſpecial Prouidence ſo aſſiſted the memory, the will, and hands of theſe Tranſcribers, as to write nothing but what was exactly found in the firſt Original Scripture; with much more reaſon will He euer aſſiſt his Church to admit or approue of no Scripture, nor Doctrin, but what is genuine, pure, and Orthodox.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To reinforce this argument. I licence Mr: Stilling: to chuſe amongſt ſo many lections of the new Teſtament as he ſaith, are collected by Robert Stephen, one or two he likes beſt, and then I demand whether that lection agrees with the vulgar latin or differ's from it? If't agree, there is no reaſon to quarrel with the Vulgar; if it be different in any material point, we are caſt vpon the greateſt vncertainties immaginable, for the diſpute will then be, whether that Copie which he followes, ought to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the Vulgar Latin? And here, Sr. you and I muſt come to clear Principles. Wee ſay firſt. The Vulgar latin tranſlated, or at leaſt Corrected at Pope Damaſus Command by that learned
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102688:39"/> and profound Doctor S. Hierom, hath been read in the Church<note place="margin">The vulgar latin of long vſe in the Church.</note> without reproof, for à thouſand years and vpward. None but one Rufinus (and this only at the beginning whilſt S. Hierom liued) excepted againſt it. S. Auſtin, all know. Lib. de ciuit. 18. c. 4. 3. highly commend's S. Hieroms great labours, and learning in the three tongues. Not any in the enſuing ages found the work repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, innumerable worthy Authors haue approued it. And now, O ſtrange time! à few Nouelliſts whoſe whole induſtry is only to pull down, to build nothing, disdainfully call it <hi>Romes great Diana.</hi> Be pleaſed, Sr. to anſwer and giue me as ſtrong à proof for the Authenticalneſſ of that Copy you follow (if any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be) as I giue you for our Latin Tranſlation? If you ſay the<note place="margin">S. Hierom defended, againſt Cauils.</note> Copy you follow is not the ſame which S. Hierom vſed, it is more then you know, He had as many lections, and perhaps more, than you haue ſeen, and can you ſay which he followed, and which he did not? Well. But ſuppoſe he made vſe of an other Copy different from what pleaſeth you, the Queſtion is, whether that be of leſſe credit then yours? And this ſole point cannot be decided in your fauour by any probable Principle. If you ſay, S. Hieroms Tranſlation ſeem's contrary to the Authentick Greek Copies. I anſwer firſt, you do not only auouch more then you know, but vtter an improbability; for if there had been any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difference between his Tranſlation, and the Greek he made vſe of; innumerable learned Doctors in the Catholick Church would haue eſpied the errour, and diſcouered it, before you were born. Pray you remember your own diſcours P. 215. and. 216. where you ſay; you may be ſufficiently aſſured that no Material corruption is in the Books of Scripture without our Churches Teſtimony, becauſe Catholiks of old were alwayes as vigilant to preſerue the Scriptures purity, as Hereticks ready to depraue it: For you ſay, when <hi>Marcion</hi> began to clip the Text <hi>Irenaeus</hi> preſently took notice and rebuked him, and ſo did <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reſpectiuely to others, who reſcued Scripture from the violent hands of ſuch as attempted to falſify it. Lay then yours on your breſt and once ſpeak ingenuously, can you perſwade your ſelf, if
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102688:40"/> any conſiderable errour had been in our Vulgar Edition, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary<note place="margin">Catholick authors would haue noted errours in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, had there been any.</note> to Faith or Good manners, that thoſe many worthy learned Catholicks in the ages after S. Hierom would not haue noted it, and releaſed it from Corruption? What? For à thouſand years, was there no <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> no <hi>Tertullian,</hi> no <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> no <hi>Ambroſe</hi> &amp;c. that took notice of ſo important à matter whereon the ſaluation of ſouls depended? Again (And this Argument euer pinches) was there no <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> no <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in all thoſe ages, (when they ſaw the Doctrin of Scripture go to ruin by theſe ſuppoſed erring Papiſts, that reſcued the Doctrin from errour, as they did the letter of ſcripture from corruption?</p>
               <p n="7">7. You tell vs. 2. That among thoſe multitudes of lections in the new Teſtament obſerued by Robert Stephen, which were perhaps occaſioned in the general diſperſion of Copies by the Multitudes of Tranſcriptions, through the ignorance or careleſneſſ of the Tranſcribers, there are none which ſeem material or intrench vpon the integrity of Scripture, as à rule of Faith and manners: They are therefore, ſay you, <hi>but racings of the skin, but no wounds of any vital part.</hi> And is it poſſible? Can you find more then ſuch racings in the Vulgar Latin? can you diſcouer à wound in any vital part therof? I challenge you to ſpeak to the cauſe in this particular, but I know you cannot. Why therefore may not the Vulgar bee admitted amongſt the reſt? The reaſon of my aſſertion is. You cannot find ſuch à wound in the Vulgar, vnleſſ you produce à Copy of Scripture more genuine and pure without Diſpute, but this, whether you haue recourſe to the Greek or any Latin tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation will, be more doubted of by whole multitudes of learned men, then the vulgar now read in the Church: Therefore you cannot come to ſo much certainty of any Scripture as excludes à poſſibility of all reaſonable doubting. Which truth ſeem's ſo euident <hi>ad hominem</hi> that it needs no further proof, but this only, The Sectary ſaith, our Vulgar tranſlation is not pure, we ſay and proue it, his English Bibles different from the Greek in the new Teſtament, are Corrupted, (ſee many of theſe errours noted before the Rhems Teſtament), Therefore if the Proteſtant reiect's the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102688:40"/> now Authentick latin Edition he has no ſuch certainty of any<note place="margin">The vulgar Latin reiected, Proteſtants haue not Certainty of any Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation.</note> Tranſlation extant, as excludes <hi>à poſsibility of all reaſonable doubting,</hi> vnleſſ he makes his own parties opinion for what he ſaith vndu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable and our contrary aſſertion improbable, which is foul play.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Some ſectary may reply; He excepts not againſt the Vulgar Latin which is our <hi>Sixtine</hi> and <hi>Clementine Bible,</hi> as guilty of any Material errour, but of leſſer faults only, and with ſuch charitable eyes hee look's on all other verſions Thus much integrity, I hope,<note place="margin">Sectaries muſt approue the Vulgar latin Bible.</note> 
                  <hi>Mr. Stilling:</hi> allowes it p: 216. where he takes notice of à <hi>peculiar hand of Diuine Prouidence</hi> in preſeruing the Authentick Records of Scripture ſafe to our dayes. By the way: it's pitty he omitted to note alſo the like prouidence in preſeruing the Doctrin of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pure ſo long: But hereof we haue ſaid enough already. All therefore I note at preſent is. 1. If God shewed à particular Prouidence in preſeruing Scripture, pure to our dayes, the Vulgar Latin according to <hi>Mr: Stilling:</hi> Cannot be guilty of any material errour, for were it guilty, this peculiar Prouidence would haue failed in the great moral body of the Roman Catholick Church, which hath read this Scripture, and held it incorrupt for ten whole ages; And Conſequently <hi>Mr: Stilling:</hi> muſt acknowledge à want of ſpecial Prouidence in order to the preſeruation of all authentick Records euery where. Grant thus much, and no Sectary can haue ſo great moral aſſurance of ſcripture as excludes all reaſonable doubting, for, if God hath permitted à whole ample Church to be deluded with à Bible notably corrupted: The Certainty of Scripture, which excludes all reaſonable doubting, fail's the ſectary, who either muſt admit of an other latin Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſtinct from ours, or haue recourſe to the Greek Text, but he approues of no latin Tranſlation as totally pure and incorrupt, (though S. Hierom obſerues in his praeface to the Goſpels. <hi>Tot ſunt Exemplaria quot Codices,</hi> there are many of them) Therefore He muſt haue recourſe to the Greek, which is vſual.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Hence I argue. If God shewed not particular Prouidence in preſeruing our latin Edition from notable errour, ſo diligently reuiewed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102688:41"/> by S. Hierom, and approued alſo not only by many learned Writers in after ages, but by à whole Church; it is no leſſe then temerarious to allow greater ſecurity to any Greek Copy; for can the Sectary<note place="margin">An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in behalfe of our Latin Edition.</note> ſay, that Gods peculiar hand of prouidence alwais ſo attended the Tranſcriber or Printers of the Greek Copies, that nothing could be written but pure Apoſtolical Scripture, and with any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance own à want, à defect, à ſubtraction, of this peculiar prouidence to à Scripture, approued of by à whole Church? Obſerue well the difficulty. Where Gods ſpecial Prouidence is, there we haue infallible aſſurance, you grant God's ſpecial Authentick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords had not come ſafe to our hands) therefore you cannot ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally deny it to that Scripture, which the Church approues.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe firſt propoſition. If the Proteſtant reiect's our Vulgar Edition as not Authentick, or as viciated in any material point touching Faith and manners, He improbably pretend's to haue ſo much certainty of Scripture as excludes à poſſibility <hi>of reaſonable</hi> doubting. To proue the Aſſertion I will here giue you à few <hi>Poſtulata</hi> vſually held indubitable by moſt learned men, who haue writ large preludes (called <hi>Prolegomena</hi>) to holy Scripture. Neither Catholick nor proteſtant shall rationally except againſt my
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102688:41"/> ſuppoſitions. Firſt it is Certain, that the greateſt part of the old<note place="margin">The first ſuppoſition</note> Teſtament was Originally writ in Hebrew, but whether that ancient Copy hath been euer ſince preſerued pure, chiefly after S. Hieroms time, or notably corrupted by negligence or malice, is very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Learned men ſtand for the Affirmatiue, and none, I think, can deny ſome leſſer errours when greater are pretended. You may ſee theſe different opinions of Authors <hi>in Prolegomen:</hi> Ad <hi>Biblia Maxima,</hi> And the particular ſuppoſed errours largely noted by Salmeron Prolegom: 4. It would be too long à work to inſiſt on this ſubiect, and not for me to determine what is true: All I contend for here, is an vncertainty whilſt great Authors are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, and this is done, to conclude, what I intend againſt Sectaries.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is again certain that the greateſt part of the new Teſtament was writ in Greek, but here we meet with the ſame difficulty, and inquire. Whether the Greek by chance or inaduertancy has been corrupted ſince the Apoſtles time? This at leaſt (if not more) is<note place="margin">The ſecond ſuppoſition.</note> doubtful: Graue Authors hold the Affirmatiue. See Serarius in Prolegom: Cap. 13. and Bonfrer, c. 14. and the errours noted. If Proteſtants deny them, or think their own authority weighty enough to Contradict our Doctors, the matter in Controuerſy, is ſtill doubtful. So much I plead, and no more. 3. It is certain that all other Bibles are only Tranſlations, or Tranſcriptions of<note place="margin">The third.</note> the Original Hebrew and Greek. The Greek verſion of the 72. interpreters out of the Hebrew (or as wee vſually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

One is, whether that Tranſlation be the firſt, For Clement Alex: and Euſeb: cited <hi>Bibl: Max:</hi> ſect. 18. c. 2. ſeem to hold an other more ancient, before the time of Alexander the great. How euer, admit, which is perhaps true, the 70. verſion to be the moſt ancient, we haue yet matter enough of Diſpute concerning it, and one great Queſtion is whether at this day, that verſion be yet preſerued pure, The ancient Archetyps wherof, more probably are not now extant, but when or where loſt, remains vncertain. See <hi>Bib: Max:</hi> ſect. 18. c. 10. Authors ſay, it is corrupted through the ignorance or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

Came forth by the induſtry of Cardinal Anton: Caraffa, wherin moſt learned men laboured nine whole years, and it was perfected about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Sixtus 5. Raign. The greateſt difficulty yet remains. It is moſt certain, the verſion of the 70. Interpreters differ's ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably from the Hebrew Text, chiefly in the computation of years, or point of Cronology, that our venerable Bede, though à great Scholler and one as humble as learned, ingenuously confeſſeth,<note place="margin">Venerable Bedes Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement.</note> he cannot reconcile thoſe Antilogies. See Bib: Max: c. 8. fine. Who then can tell me when we find theſe lections of the Hebrew and of the Septuagint oppoſite to one an other, which is to be preferred? Moſt learned men ſtand for the Hebrew, as many for the 70. You may ſee theſe diſſenting Authors quoted in <hi>Proleg: Bib: Max:</hi> Sect: 18. c. 11. and how ſome to accord them, ſay, That the Holy Ghoſt would haue the Septuagint now to add to the Hebrew, now to diminish according to his good pleaſure. See Bib: Max: cap: 8. fine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But let vs proceed to à further matter of doubting. Long after the Edition of the Septuagint, came forth three other Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations made by three vngodly men. <hi>Aquila, Symmachus,</hi> and <hi>Theodotio.

Theodotion firſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, then à Sectary of Marcions and Ebions errours, laſtly à Proſylite, embraced Iudaiſm (and therefore S. Hierome in 3. Habacuc call's theſe three, now named, <hi>Semi-Chriſtianos,</hi> half Chriſtians) followed à middle way between <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Symmachus</hi> and tranſlated Scripture with greater Simplicity, more agreable to the 70. verſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. An other Edition aſcribed to Origen, not becauſe he made<note place="margin">Origens great indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</note> à new verſion, but with an immenſe labour, to conſerue the 70. Greek pure, firſt compoſed his <hi>Tetrapla</hi> or à Bible branched into 4. Columns. The firſt contained the 70. verſion, the 2. Aquilas; The 3. Symmachus his Tranſlation. The 4. that of Theodotion. Afterward this great Doctor, learning the Hebrew language, made his <hi>Hexapla,</hi> that is à bible with 6. Columns. The firſt contained the Hebrew Text, the 2. the Hebrew in Greek Characters, the other 4. the Verſion of the 70. of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. Now becauſe there were two more Greek Verſions called the <hi>fift</hi> and <hi>Sixt</hi> Editions, Origen compoſed his <hi>Octopla,</hi> or Bible diſtinguished into 8. Columns.

               <p n="6">6 Thus much briefly premiſed (for we haue not ſaid half of what might be alleged) concerning the doubts and vncertainty of various editions, I here appeal to euery diſtintereſſed iudgement<note place="margin">Reflection made vpon theſe doubts.</note> and ask whether it be not mighty difficult, or rather impoſſible, to ſay abſolutely by the force of our priuate fallible knowledge, by witt or humane induſtry only: <hi>This book, This Edition is Gods true ſincere word,</hi> as it was writ by the <hi>Hagiographers?</hi> And here I muſt mind Mr: Stilling: of his not well conſidered Doctrin, who P. 196. ſeems to own ſo great certainty of Scripture as excludes

                  <hi>the poſsibility of all reaſonable doubting,</hi> and pag 215. aſſerts. <hi>We may be ſufficiently aſſured that there are no Material Corruptions in the books of Scripture, without your Churches Testimony.</hi> Good Sr. leaue of theſe generalities, and tell vs plainly of what Edition you ſpeak? What particular verſion haue you, which muſt be ſuppoſed ſo authentick, or ſo free from all errour, as may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude à poſſibility of reaſonable doubting, before you haue the Churches Teſtimony or toleration for it? Name one, and much<note place="margin">A queſtion propoſed to Sectaries.</note> is done. Will you follow the Hebrew and Greek Copies now extant? You ſee moſt learned men, whoſe knowledge and Authority is not inferiour to yours, ſay both are corrupted, and thus much alone weakens the certainty you pretend to? Will you admit of the 70. Tranſlation as pure and Authentick? Be pleaſed to reconcile the Antilogies, between that and the Hebrew Text, or ſay that the Septuagint, though euer of great veneration in the Church, hath its errours. Will you plead for what Aquila or Symmachus haue done? Theſe are euidently corrupted, and in points moſt Material touching Chriſt our Lord. Will you ſay that all Copies, none excepted, all Tranſlations whether Greek or Latin now extant are pure Scripture in the Materials of Faith and manners? It is highly improbable, and therefore hitherto we come to no Solid Principle, to no certainty which excludes the poſſibility of reaſonable doubting. O ſaith Mr: Stilling: to proue that no Material Corruptions ſtained the Scripture now extant, <hi>We</hi> (that is Sectaries) diligently compare the preſent Copies with the moſt ancient <hi>M S S. we obſerue</hi> the citations of<note place="margin">Of ſectaries Comparing Scripture with the more ancient Copies.</note> thoſe ancient Fathers who liued when ſome Autograph's were extant, and then (moſt likely) we haue the pure word of God. You compare? Pray you anſwer? were there not others in the Catholick Church before Sectaries troubled the world, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in comparing Copies and Manuſcripts together, as you haue lately been? Was S. Hierom, think you, negligent in this particular? Or did the Primitiue Church before S. Hierom when it read that ancient Edition called <hi>Itala,</hi> and preferred it before all other Lections, fail to examin which Copy was beſt?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102688:44"/> Yet more. If we come to later times and ponder well, what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence what vigilancy, what induſtry attended the Correction of the <hi>Sixtin</hi> and <hi>Clementine</hi> Bibles, Sectaries may blush at their Oſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, and too ſleight Cauils at our Vulgar latin. Read the preface to Sixtus 5. Edition, Antwerp print 1599. with other refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions made in Bib: Max: Sect 20. c. 4. and you will ſee ſo great à care and induſtry vſed in this correction, that humanly ſpeaking more could not be deſired.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Many Copies and old <hi>M S S.</hi> were at the Popes command ſought for, and brought to Rome, Not only ſome chief and ſelected Cardinals in the time of Pope Pius the 4. but other great ſchollers alſo, profoundy learned in the knowledge of Scripture, and skilful in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> Syriack, Chaldee, and Greek, began the<note place="margin">Great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence vſed in the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Vulgar.</note> Correction of the Vulgar Latin, and to accomplish the work, diligently examined theſe ancient books, theſe <hi>M S S,</hi> the beſt Originals of Hebrew and Greek, and commentaries alſo of the moſt ancient Fathers &amp;c. Speak therefore of humane induſtry, we may boldly ſay, our Vulgar Latin hath been reuiewed, and corrected with greater care, than euer verſion was ſet forth by Sectaries. But if theſe men will ſtill pretend to find any Material errour in the Vulgar, I only ask by what more Authentick Copy can they, ſo much as probably hope to amend it? By the Hebrew and Greek? Toyes. Diſpute the Queſtion rigidly, there is leſſe aſſurance of theſe ſuppoſed Originals integrity, then of the Vulgar Latin ſo induſtriouſly examined not only by the beſt Hebrew and Greek Copies now extant, but alſo by other ancient <hi>M S S.</hi> and commentaries of the Fathers.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I cannot therefore imagin what Mr: Stillingfleet aimes at, when he tell's vs page. 215. that Doctor Iames who had taken the pains to compare not only the Sixtine Clementine Bibles, but the Clementine Edition with the Louain Annotations, makes it appear, there are 10000. differences in the Louain Annotations from the Vulgar Latin, and that theſe differences ariſe, from Comparing <hi>it</hi> (that is ſure the Vulgar Latin) with the Hebrew,<note place="margin">Doctor Ia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes oppoſed.</note> Greek, and Chaldee- What would the man haue think yee?
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102688:44"/> Will he ſuppoſe firſt, that Thomas Iames hitt's right in euery thing he ſaies? The learned Iames Gretſer whoſe authority is euery whit as good the whole world over as that of Mr. Iames. Tom. 1. Ad lib. 2.

Here we may come to an endles wrangling about the Genuine ſignification of words, but decide Nothing. God help vs, if the knowledge of true Scripture depend's on ſuch petty Nicities, and fruitles quarrelling. 4. And this is to be noted. Were theſe differences more then are made by Mr. Iames, The queſtion would then be, whether they imply any Material alteration concerning <hi>Faith or Manners,</hi> or introduce notable errour contrary to God's reuealed verities, or finally bee meer verbal differences, grounded on the obſcure ſignification of Original words? If Mr: Stilling: only pretend's this later, let him remember his own expreſſion of <hi>racings of the skin,</hi> and know, that there was neuer Tranſlation in the world, which may not be thus Cauilled at. If any Material alteration be pleaded he both ſpeaks à lowd vntruth, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict's himſelf, when he takes notice of à peculiar hand of Diuine Prouidence in preſeruing the Authentick records of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſafe to our dayes. 2. He is to name that Authentick Copy, either Original or tranſlation, by the indiſputable integrity wherof, theſe ſuppoſed errours may bee cancelled, and Gods pure reuealed verities put in their place: But to do this after ſo immenſe labour and diligence vſed in the correction of the Vulgar, will proue no leſſe than à vain attempt, or rather à deſperate impoſſibility.

That man may rationally doubt of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture who reiects the ſtrongeſt aſſurance imaginable, and makes choiſe of à weaker, But this is done, if he doubts of, or denies the Authenticalness of the Vulgar. The reaſon is firſt becauſe He hath no other Edition, as is now ſaid, examined with more care or greater induſtry, and this ground's the higheſt humane aſſurance conceiuable. 2. Becauſe the Vulgar is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by God's Holy Church which giues infallible certainty. if therefore the integrity of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> be not vnqueſtionably authentick, he wants that certainty which excludes à <hi>Poſsibility of doubting,</hi> And Much leſs aſſurance hath the Sectary of his own later iarring Editions of Scripture, which breed nothing but confuſion to the very Authors, and all who read them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I ſay. 2.

The reaſon is. To doe thus much, he muſt ſuppoſe that other Copy he would correct by, to be more pure than the Vulgar, and this cannot be proued vpon any receiued Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. Now if you obiect. Authors Commonly deny not ſome obſcurities or leſſer verbal faults to haue been in the Vulgar, I anſwer that's nothing to the purpoſe were all true, for it doth not therefore follow, it can be corrected by any other Copy which is more Authentick Scripture, A leſſe authentick Bible may help herein, when other lections are accuratly examined, yet may be faulty in greater matters.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I ſay. 3. No Tradition no Teſtimony which is fallible and may be fals, can giue ſo great aſſurance of Authentick Scripture as Diuine Faith requires, or that aſſurance which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102688:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> à poſſibility of reaſonable doubting, which is to ſay in other words: The infallible Teſtimony of the Church is abſolutely<note place="margin">A Teſtimony in fallible, is neceſſary to aſcertain Scripture.</note> neceſſary to aſcertain vs of Authentick Scripture. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is directly againſt Mr: Stilling: who page 226. makes the certainty Chriſtians haue of the books of Scripture ſo fallible, that it may be falſe, yet enhaunſes the certainty of the Doctrin there contained to à note higher, of infallibility. We shall ſee the leuity of this diſtinction fully diſcouered hereafter, and our Aſſertion proued in à more proper place. All I will ſay at preſent, is. No man can be certainly aſſured of true Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vnles he firſt come to à certainty of à true Church inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of Scripture. Find out therefore the true Church and we haue all we ſeek for, I mean true Scripture with it, vnles one tend's to à high degree of madneſſe and Aſſert's, that the true Church of Chriſt cheated into an erroneous Bible, was depriued of pure and authentick Scripture.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And here I will propoſe an Argument for the Vulgar Latin which Mr: ſtilling: shall not anſwer. In what euer Society of Chriſtians we find faith intirely true, we haue there Authentick Scripture: But from Luthers time vpward to the 4. or 5. age faith intirely true, was only found in the Roman Catholick Church, and in no other Society of Chriſtians, Therefore the Roman Catholick Church which read ſo many ages the Vulgar Latin as Authentick, had true Scripture. I proue<note place="margin">An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prouing the Vulgar Latin Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick.</note> the Minor, wherin only is difficulty. If the Roman Church erred for ſo vaſt à time in any point of Diuine Faith, there was no faith intirely true the whole Chriſtian world ouer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all other Societies denominated Chriſtians were known condemned Hereticks, and conſequently had not true faith, Therefore either the Catholick Roman Church enioy'd that bleſſing, or we muſt grant à want of faith for ten ages the whole world ouer. But if this Church had Faith intirely true, it preſerued alſo Authentick Scripture (for where true faith is there you haue true Scripture) If not; it followes that wee haue no aſſurance at all either of the one or other. Therefore if all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102688:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> Churches vniuerſally erred in points of faith, no Church can giue ſo much aſſurance of authentick Scripture, as excludes à Poſſibility of reaſonable doubting. See more here of in the other Treatiſe Diſcours. 2. c. 2. n. 8.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Now we are to ſolue à difficulty which may ariſe from our former diſcourſe, where 't is ſaid. If one rely on humane authority which is fallible and may be falſe, ſo much miſtruſt, ſo<note place="margin">A difficulty propoſed, and ſolued.</note> many doubts occurr concening the Originals and various Lections, that none can haue indubitable aſſurance of Scripture, How therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re could the Church without moral certainty (and greater too) had of the Authentick books, antecedently to the Councils declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, determin ſo peremptorily, this Edition of the Vulgar to be Authentick, yea and to preferr it before other <hi>Latin</hi> Copies? I might here firſt by the way demand, vpon what certainty can the Sectary prefer his Edition (take which hee will) before the Vulgar Latin? What euer moral aſſurance he has independently of the Churche's Teſtimony for his Bible, the Church has greater for Hers. But to ſolue the difficulty poſitiuely. I ſay the Church after all moral diligence, proceeded in this particular vpon an<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Scripture.</note> vndeniable Principle, which is, that God by ſpecial Prouidence preſerued as well Scripture free from Material corruption, as Church Doctrin pure and orthodox: in both, wee Catholiks rely on peculiar Prouidence, and all muſt do ſo, vnleſs they, will rob Chriſt's Sponſe of all the treaſure she has, and violently take from her not only Orthodox Faith, but Scripture alſo.</p>
               <p>The Church therefore in her Declaration depended not on à meer Moral fallible certainty, which may be falſe, but vpon <hi>infallible Tradition.</hi> This gaue indubitable aſſurance of the Scriptures purity, free from all material errour. Here is her laſt Principle. And thus you ſee à vaſt difference between the Church and Sectaries. The Church plead's poſſeſſion of Authentick Scripture vpon Gods gracious Prouidence, and hath it warranted by indubitable Tradition, the Sectary reiect's this infallible ground, and run's away, with no man knowes what Certainty, and in doing ſo, caſt's himſelf vpon the greateſt doubts imaginable concerning ſcripture.</p>

Perhaps you will ſay, Mr: Stilling: p. 213. relies in this matter on the vniuerſal conſent of all Chriſtians, and Therefore includes the Teſtimony of the Roman Catholick Church. I anſwer firſt. Hee hath not the conſent of this Church for all thoſe Editions He approues, and Conſequently the greateſt part of à vniuerſal conſent fail's. I anſwer 2. He<note place="margin">Sectaries Cannot rely on the Churches infallible Teſtimony.</note> neither doth nor can (remaining Proteſtant) admit of the Catholiks ſureſt Teſtimony or Tradition, for our Church own's in this moſt weighty matter, an infallible certain Tradition, Mr: Stilling: reiect's that, therefore he hath nothing from our Church which fauours his Aſſertion, drawn from the moſt aſſured conſent of all Chriſtians concerning Authentick Scripture. And here by the way, I cannot but take notice of this Gentlemans weightles obiection Pag. 216. who grants, there can be no certainty as to the Copies of Scripture, but from Tradition. <hi>But think not to fob vs off</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the Tradition of the preſent Church inſtead of the Church of all ages, with the Tradition of your Church, instead of the Catholick</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with the ambiguous teſtimonies of two or three Fathers inſtead of the vniuerſal conſent of the Church, ſince the Apostles times</hi> Anſw.

You ſee, He ſlights the Teſtimony of two or three Fathers (needed we relief from them) and I am ſure the vnanimous agreement of all Fathers makes no where the conſent of the Church in all antecedent ages, contrary to our preſent Churches Tradition. From whom therefore shall we learn? On what vndubitable Principle can we reſt, or ſay ſuch was the Tradition concerning Scripture in pas't ages but from the preſent Churches Teſtimony? It is impoſſible to pitch on any other Proof which is ſurer, or half ſo ſure.</p>

Though the Council of Trent ſeſs. 4. declares this Edition of the Vulgar to be Authentick, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr's it before all other latin Editions, <hi>Quae circumferuntur,</hi> which are now abroad, it doth not thereby detract any thing, from the credit and authority of the ancient <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, whereof Authors diſpute (whether they be pure or no) whilſt the Church is ſilent and defin's nothing. Neither doth the Council reiect the Verſion of the Septuagint, or that ancient Latin Copy called <hi>Itala,</hi> (read in the Church before S. Hierom) as <hi>Vnauthentick</hi> in any material point: for this Argument is conuincing to the contrary. As it is madnes to ſay. Chriſts Church had not true Scripture ſince S.

               <p n="2">2. Note 3. Tranſlations may be faulty three wayes chiefly. 1. More ambiguity and darknes may lye in à tranſlated word than in the Original, and this fault (if any) is remediless, becauſe the latin, or à Vulgar language reacheth not alwais to the full Energy and ſignification of an <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherof you haue ſome examples in that learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the English Rhems Teſtament anno 1600. 2.

To amend this, and other ſlighter faults, the Church, as I ſaid aboue, and you may read in the preface to the Sixtine Bibles, hath vſed the greateſt induſtry imaginable.

If Pope Sixtus made à <hi>Brieue,</hi> whereby he commanded his Edition ſo accuratly recogniſed, to be receiued for indubitable authentick Scripture, and therefore free from errours, How could he afterward find ſuch faults as cauſed him to intend à new impreſſion of the whole work?

But grant more, that Sixtus who had Choice of various lections of Scripture, followed perhaps leſſe circumſpectly ſome darker or more ambiguous Copy, which Clement the 8<hi rend="sup">.th</hi> after à diligent ſearch into other Editions, brought to greater Clarity, and therfore read's à little differently. Nothing is yet ſo much as probably alleged, cauſal of any errour in <hi>Faith,</hi> or Contrary to the eſſential <hi>verities</hi> of Scripture. For as <hi>Tannerus</hi> well obſerues Tom. 3.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102688:50"/> genuin Text. Anſw. After all his labour He pretend's this, but<note place="margin">How and what Sixtus pretend's.</note> with <hi>à caution</hi> often repeated in the Bull, <hi>quoad eius ſieri potest: prout optime ſieri potuit</hi> &amp;c. That is as well as then could be &amp;c. The firm or certain Argument therefore is. The Church euer preſerued true and Genuin Scripture, which is either to be found in the ancient approued Copies both printed and <hi>manuſcript<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or no where, Theſe, Pope Sixtus diligently ſearched into, therefore his Edition is true genuin Scripture, which no Catholick denies, if by true and genuin Scripture we vnderſtand, not an Excluſion of all leſſer faults, but of greater contrary to the purity of Faith and Religion, and ſo far Sixtus Edition is blamleſſe, although as Tanner now cited. n. 83. obſerues, perhaps not altogether ſo circumſpectly done, nor euery way fit to the publick edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, <hi>Wherin there is à latitude within the Compaſs of truth, and integrity.</hi> And who euer read's Pope Sixtus own Bull before his Bible, can force no more out of it but this truth, that many faults which had got into other Copies, are accuratly corrected in his Edition, wherof no man can doubt; with all,<note place="margin">Many faults amended by Sixtus</note> that it contains the Vulgar Latin Edition amended at leaſt, in many things, and conſequently is authentick Scripture. Sixtus ſaith not, he amended all leſſer faults wheron Religion has no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, but rather diſclaimes buſying himſelf with ſo ſmall à ſeruice.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Mr: Stilling: obiects 4. The vaſt difference between the Clementine and Sixtine Bibles lay in this, that Clement corrected the Vulgar Latin according to the Original in aboue two thouſand places, when the contrary reading was eſtablished by Sixtus. Anſw: Here is no proof but only three improbable Aſſertions. Who aſſures you, Sr. of any vaſt difference between theſe two Editions? Or inform's you ſo exactly of aboue two thouſand different places? Or, why finally do you tell vs of à contrary reading eſtablished by Sixtus? A reading, Good Sr, may be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,<note place="margin">No Contrary Reading in Sixtus his Edition.</note> and yet not contrary in any material point of faith or manners, and ſo far Sixtus is defenſible. If there be any other difference or Contrariety not touching on Faith and Religion, becauſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102688:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> is longer or shorter, leſſe clear in the one, and more ſignificant in the other verſion, this concern's vs not, both may be right within the <hi>compaſs of truth,</hi> and without any material fault. But ſaith Mr: Stilling: if the Latin Copies be à ſure Rule to iudge of the authenticalneſſe of the Text by, much more shall the ancient Copies of the Original <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> be à ſurer Rule. Anſw: Had we now the authentick true Copies of the ancient Hebrew and Greek we should ſoon acquieſce, but Sectaries know well this is more then doubtful, yea almoſt certain that both are corrupted, how farr I ſay not, but morally ſpeaking the Hebrew cannot but be corrupted by reaſon of the great ſimilitude in<note place="margin">The Hebrew text, ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note> many letters, and the acceſs of points added by the perfidious <hi>Maſoreths</hi> after S. Hieroms age, which may change the ſence of Scripture, and very notably. See Gretſerus Defens. Bellar: Tom 1. lib. 2. c. 2. I wonder why Mr: Stilling: is ſo earneſt for the Greek, which our English Sectaries vtterly leaue when 'tis for their purpoſe. I haue told you enough already of <hi>Images</hi> tranſlated for <hi>Idols: Elders</hi> for <hi>Prieſts: Ordinances</hi> for <hi>Traditions</hi> &amp;c.

               <p n="1">1. LEt vs if you pleaſe ſuppoſe, that wee and Sectaries had now in our hands the very Autograph's of the whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as it was once writ by the Prophets and Apoſtles, or if you would rather, Imagin the book drop't down from Heauen pure, and euery way incorrupt. I ſay the Sectary has not probable aſſurance of Scripture, much leſs ſuch à certainty as excludes à <hi>poſsibility of reaſonable doubting.</hi> The ground of my Aſſertion is this vndeniable Principle owned as well by Proteſtants, as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. Viz Scripture ſolely conſidered according to the exteriour letter, vnleſs the true ſenſe intended by the Holy Ghoſt be had, is no Scripture to the Reader. For example: Becauſe the Arian read's that ſacred truth. <hi>My Father is greater then I,</hi> and ſtand's meerly vpon the bare ſound of words without the ſenſe intended by the Holy Ghoſt, Hee hath no true Scripture. Whence it is, that S. Auſtin ſerm: 70. Temp. hold's Hereticks moſt vnhappy, becauſe they take the <hi>words without the ſenſe,</hi> haue à <hi>body without</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Words without the true ſenſe, no Scripture.</note>

Let vs not think, that the Goſpel lyes in the words of Scripture but in the ſenſe of thoſe words we read, not in the <hi>out-ſyde</hi> but in the pith and marrow of it. There is no need of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102688:54"/> quoting more Fathers. The Principle is agreed on by all, and moſt indubitable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence I argue. Nothing is more eſſential to ſcripture than the ſenſe deliuered by the Holy Ghoſt: but the Proteſtant, where he is moſt concerned, has not ſo much aſſurance of the ſenſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Holy Ghoſt, as excludes à Poſſibility <hi>of reaſonable doubting,</hi> and I proue it. He is moſt concerned, when he oppoſes our Catholick Doctrin and ſtand's vp in defenſe of his own opinions, but in neither has he ſuch an indubitable aſſurance of the Scriptures ſenſe, as excludes à poſſibility of reaſonable doubting, and this I ſay is euident, For he cannot haue ſo much aſſurance if as weighty, yea à far more weighty authority contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict's his ſenſe. But it is clear that not only the preſent Roman Church, but other particular Churches in former ages reputed Orthodox, contradict that ſenſe the Proteſtant drawes from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">But Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries haue no Certainty of the ſenſe.</note> (when he oppoſeth Catholick Doctrin or defends his own ſingular opinions) Therefore he has not ſo much certainty of the Scriptures ſenſe, as excludes the poſſibility of <hi>reaſonable doubting.</hi> Now, that the ſole iudgement of our preſent Catholick Church (to diſpute the thing no higher) is as great vpon all accounts, as the iudgement of Proteſtants, ſeem's vndeniable; And that the Teſtimony of our Church weakens the aſſurance of that ſenſe of Scripture which Proteſtants lay claim to, is moſt euident, as wee ſee in ſchool opinions (when contrary to one an other) for no man, whether Philoſopher or Diuine, can prudently hold his opinion ſo certain as excludes <hi>à Poſsibility of doubting</hi> when as many, wholly, as learned yea more learned and numerous, after à full knowledge had of it and long Study alſo, deny that certainty. Thus much I ſay is euident. Now if the Proteſtant tells' vs, the Authority of his party weakens as much that ſenſe wee make of Scripture, as the contrary iudgement of our Church leſſens his, I anſwer. The reply here is to no purpoſe For all I proue at preſent is, that he want's this certainty, whether we haue it or not, is an other quaeſtion, and clearly decided for the Catholik cauſe in the other Treatiſe. Diſc. 2. c. 9. <hi>per totum.</hi> Again, were all granted the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102688:54"/> would haue. Thus much (which is moſt fals,) only followes, that neither of vs know aſſuredly the ſenſe of Scripture, which touches not the difficulty now in controuerſy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. My 2. Argument is ſo demonſtratiue that if the Proteſtant<note place="margin">A 2 Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> most Conuincing.</note> will pleaſe to ſolue it, I'le neuer trouble him more with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. To propoſe it clearly, know only thus much. That when the ſectary read's Scripture and would haue it to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, He either ouer reaches the Text, or fall's short of its meaning. For example. To those words of S. Math. <hi>This is my body</hi> he adds this, as good ſenſe. This is <hi>à ſigne, or figure only of my body.</hi> Mark well: We both read the ſame words, but Catholicks deny that to be Scripture, not becauſe we deny the <hi>words,</hi> but his ſenſe we ſay is no ſcripture. To that of our Sauiour. <hi>I am with you alwaies to the end of the world.</hi> He adds, I am with you alwaies by à fitting, but no infallible aſſiſtance: We ſay this is no Scripture. To that of S.

               <p>Theſe Additions of <hi>à ſign only,</hi> of à fitting <hi>Aſsiſtance,</hi> of <hi>iustification before men</hi> &amp;c, are either the true ſenſe intended by the Holy Ghoſt or Sectaries fancy, but moſt euidently they are not the ſenſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Holy Ghoſt, for this muſt either be gathered out of<note place="margin">Sectaries gloſſes and additions, not ſcripture.</note> ſo many expreſs words of Holy writ which is prodigiously falſe, or muſt ariſe from the Holy Ghoſts <hi>infallible aſsistance</hi> whereby Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as people Illuminated aboue all others giue vs the true meaning of Scripture; and this beſides the Paradox, when à whole learned Church contradict's the aſſertion, is moſt deſtructiue of the Proteſtants own Principle: For they ſay, the Holy Ghoſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret's by none, enlightens none, teaches none to deliuer the true ſenſe of Scripture, but ſuch as do it infallibly, which Truth is moſt vndoubted. They ſay again, when they giue the ſenſe of Scripture, or interpret God's word, they do it <hi>ſo fallibly, that it may be falſe,</hi> or if they interpret infallibly; and cannot err, <hi>Eo ipſo,</hi> they are ſo farr infallible, which they vtterly deny. See Diſc. 2. c. 9. n. 8. what
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102688:55"/> then remains but that the ſenſe of Scripture propoſed to vs by ſuch fallible Teachers, is only the thought of their own fancy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some may reply. Proteſtants after long peruſing Scripture, and comparing ſeueral Texts together, iudge the ſenſe of theſe and<note place="margin">No more are their dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> other controuerted places by à lawful deduction, to be as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. I anſwer firſt. They shall neuer come to ſo much as à probable deduction, and I earneſtly preſs them to make their ſenſe good in the paſſages alleged, when we now ſtand to Scripture only. I anſwer. 2. ſuch dark inferences drawn from comparing Texts together not grounded on the very words, euer imply à mixture of humane diſcourſe, which therefore is fallible <hi>and may be falſe.</hi> Whence it followes, that Sectaries can belieue none of theſe ſenſes by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Faith, becauſe the laſt Motiue or formal obiect of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is à fallible <hi>reaſoning</hi> only, and this may erre.

Thus I argue. Either you ſuppoſe and belieue the Doctrin of Scripture to be Diuine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you find the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there, (and propoſe theſe as the firſt Motiue, and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your belieuing Scripture) or independently of Scripture Miracles, you proue the Doctrin to be Diuine; yea, and the very miracles recounted there, to be indited by the Holy Ghoſt. If you belieue the Diuinity of Scripture induced therevnto by Miracles related in that Holy book, you aduance nothing, for all you ſay is, <hi>that you proue Scripture, Diuine becauſe it recounts theſe wonders, which are as obſcure to à Heathen as the Diuinity, or the ſacred Doctrin of Scripture is,</hi> Therefore you make à moſt vicious Circle, for you proue the Diuinity of Scripture by <hi>Miracles internal to the book,</hi> and the Miracles themſelues (not otherwiſe known) by the <hi>Diuinity of Scripture.</hi> Now if you ſay you know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Diuinity antecedently, or before you recurr to Miracles related there, Scripture-Miracles are vſeles to your purpoſe, for, if the ſuppoſition ſtand, They are yet no more but <hi>obiects of Faith,</hi> and therefore cannot ſerue you as motiues and inducements to belieue that very Diuinity, which is now ſuppoſed known <hi>aliunde,</hi> and moſt ſufficiently without them.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. One may ask, if God had neuer done any other Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles but ſuch as Scripture relates, whether theſe are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to work belief in all?

But hereof wee haue ſaid enough in the other Treatiſe. Perhaps you'l reply.

               <argument>
                  <p>The firſt and eaſiest way to find out true Religion is not by Scripture only, though all Chriſtians had moral certainty of the right Canon, and ſenſe alſo, which is to ſay, the meer owning Chriſts Doctrin, is inſufficient to proue it, to all ſort of People.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe Aſſertion may ſeem ſtrange had we not an euident proof at hand, and t'is thus. The Iewes, Turks, and Pagans (although all Chriſtians now and euer agreed in ſome chief verities concerning Chriſtian Religion, as that <hi>Ieſus is our Redeemer</hi>) reiect the Doctrin as fals, and foolish 1. Cor. 1. u. 23. <hi>We preach Christ Crucified, à ſcandal to the Iewes, and à foolery to the Gentils.</hi> Whereby you may well learn, how enormouſly Mr: Stillingfleet erred aboue when he told vs, that the meer excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and reaſonableneſs of Chriſtian Religion carries with it its own proof. Our Aſſertion is contrary, and grounded vpon this<note place="margin">The proof of our Aſſertion oppoſite to Mr. stillingfleet.</note> Principle. The Myſteries of Chriſtian Doctrin conſidered in themſelues, tranſcend all humane Capacity, and as the Apoſtle ſaith ſcandalize weak reaſon, Therefore the Myſteries meerly laid forth to à Iew or Gentile are no conuiction, becauſe they are aboue the reaſon of the very beſt Belieuers. Now if you ſay, they ought firſt to be belieued by faith without any preuious inducement, This is the worſt of fooleries, for none of the Primitiue Chriſtians, ſo much as belieued Chriſt or admitted Apoſtolical Doctrin, without rendring firſt ſome ſatisfactory reaſon (diſtinct from their faith) why they reiected the ancient Sinagogue and aſſented to that then new preach't learning. Some
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102688:60"/> preuious light therefore, diſtinct from theſe abſtruſe Myſteries, which God laies before the eye of humane reaſon induceth all, whether Iewes or Gentils, to the true belief of Chriſtianity, and Conſequently the meer ſuppoſed verity of the Doctrin only, dark in it ſelf, is no abſolute mark or firſt <hi>ſelf euident</hi> Principle,<note place="margin">The rerity of Chriſt's Doctrin no ſelfe Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> whereby we are immediatly moued to belieue ſuch high ſecrets. Pray you tell me, should any one goe amongſt ſome vnciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed People, who either haue heard nothing, or very little of Chriſt, and only relate the ſtory of his ſacred Birth in à poor ſtable, of his obſcure life from the 12<hi rend="sup">.th</hi> year of his age till he began to preach &amp;c. Would ſuch Barbarians, think yee, aſſent to theſe ſtrange things either by the force of humane reaſon, or Diuine Faith, without further proof or motiue to make all good? No certainly. Yet all is true and very true, yea, and moſt reaſonable, but the <hi>verity alone</hi> is inſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any that 'tis true.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From this short diſcourſe, whereof more in the ſecond part, theſe vndeniable inferences follow. 1. That Sectaries aſſert they know not what, when they make the true Preaching of the Goſpel and right vſe of Sacraments to be marks of the true Church. For the true Church (be it where you will) hath euer its marks antecedently ſuppoſed to the true preaching of the word, which marks, firſt manifeſt that myſtical body (at leaſt in à general way as I shall preſently declare) and thus known by à <hi>natural euidence,</hi> she propoſeth the Myſteries we belieue. Here<note place="margin">The Church is known by her marks, before we belieue.</note> is the reaſon <hi>à priori</hi> of my Aſſertion. That which is <hi>the firſt obiect of our Faith cannot be the firſt obiect of our knowledge, the Mysteries of our belief layd forth by the preaching of Gods word, are the firſt obiects of Faith,</hi> (for theſe we belieue, and as belieued they are obſcure) <hi>therefore they cannot be the firſt obiects of knowledge</hi> (if we ſpeak ſtrictly of knowledge) or marks preuiouſly inducing reaſon to belieue. Whence it is, that reaſon hath its euidence or prudent inducements laid forth vpon other extrinſical Principles, before we belieue. Belief therefore, whether you take it for the obiect <hi>aſſented to,</hi> or the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102688:61"/> act wee <hi>aſſent by</hi> (being as I ſaid obſcure) can be no mark to it ſelf or to the true Church we belieue in, for à mark is euer more known than that obiect is whereof it is à mark, or which is pointed at.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some perhaps will ſay. The Church is vſually defined. <hi>An Aſſembly of thoſe who profess the true Doctrin of Chriſt,</hi> therefore<note place="margin">An Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> true Doctrin moſt eſſential to the Church, muſt neceſſarily be known before we know the total eſſence of the Church. <hi>Ergo</hi> true Doctrin or the preaching of the word is à mark whereby we firſt find out the Church, and conſequently the Church marked with euident clear motiues, is no inducement to belieue true Doctrin. The Argument is an euident fallacy. Firſt becauſe the Illiterate and ſimple Chriſtians belieue in the Church and haue faith ſufficient to ſaluation, though they neuer arriue to an explicit<note place="margin">Briefly ſolued.</note> belief of euery particular Doctrin taught by it. 2. They either explicitly belieue all theſe particular Doctrins by Faith, and this is impoſſible, becauſe all of them were neuer propoſed <hi>explicitly,</hi> or, know them <hi>ex terminis</hi> to be Diuine Truths by humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when they are propoſed, and this is moſt vntrue. For who can ſay that this truth. <hi>Chriſt is God and conſubſtantial with his Father,</hi> is à verity more known <hi>ex terminis</hi> by humane reaſon, than the contrary errour of the Arians is? You ſee therefore the obiection is forceles: For, as one who reades Ariſtotle or Plato knowes what is ſaid, or the ſubſtance of the Doctrin by the ſenſe of their words, yet remains ignorant whether it be true or fals, without further reaſoning and inſpection, ſo à Gentil that reads our Chriſtian Doctrin in the bible may know much of its ſenſe, or what is ſaid, yet he muſt both <hi>diſcourſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> well, before<note place="margin">The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, not attained by examining the Myſteries of Faith.</note> he come to this ſetled iudgement. <hi>All I read</hi> (not euidently true ex terminis) <hi>is yet indubitably ſo.</hi> Now this iudgement is not firſt got by examining the particular verities which Scripture or the Church teaches. No. There is à farr eaſier way whereby reaſon, after à further diſcourſe concludes: that either God hath cheated the world by the Miracles, the ſanctity, The blood shedding of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102688:61"/> Martyrs, and all thoſe conuerſions wrought by the Church, or we muſt grant, That, what the Church teaches is true, And this general iudgement ariſing immediatly from à due Ponderation of the motiues of Faith (which is Science) diſpoſeth an vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to belieue this great Truth. <hi>God ſpeaks his eternal verities by that Church</hi> (be it yet where you will) <hi>which Chriſt Ieſus founded.</hi> And in this ſenſe we ſay, à general Notion or knowledge of the Church manifeſted by ſupernatural ſignes, is vſually neceſſary to the belief of euery particular Doctrin deliuered by it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently particular Doctrins can be no firſt mark, or ſign of this Oracle. Thus much is here briefly hinted at to ſolue the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Hereafter, the whole Analyſis shall be moſt particularly diſcuſſed in its due place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A. 2. inference. True Religion is firſt found by its marks<note place="margin">The true Church is known before we can know the books of ſcripture.</note> and cogniſances, before the pure and incorrupt books of Scripture can be owned as Diuine. We come therefore to à knowledge of theſe incorrupt books by the help of that Chriſtian Society where true Religion is taught, and cannot <hi>firſt know</hi> where true Religion is by the books of ſcripture only. I ſay. <hi>First know.</hi> For without all doubt when incorrupt Scripture together with the ſenſe is once admitted vpon the authority of Chriſts Church, we argue and forceably as the Fathers anciently did, againſt Sectaries by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: But all ſuch arguments <hi>preſuppoſe</hi> the Books proued Diuine, and ſacred. The reaſon of the inference is. Theſe Books only contain à ſimple narration of our Chriſtian verities, which both Iewes and Gentils ſlight, therefore though we cry neuer ſo loud Scripture <hi>is Diuine,</hi> and written by the Holy Ghoſt, we effect nothing with theſe Aliens from Chriſt, vnleſs we firſt conuince the truth by proofs diſtinct from Scripture it ſelf. And as little is<note place="margin">No diſputing by Scripture only, without the Canon and ſenſe be agreed on.</note> done, if Chriſtians of à different belief diſpute by Scripture, when neither the Canon, nor the ſenſe is agreed on. For example. Marcion produceth his Bible, The Arian his, and his ſenſe, A third à Scripture without S. Iames Epiſtle, or that to the Hebrewes, Our Sectaries Crowd in with their book, whilſt others as learned reiect
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102688:62"/> their Canon, and much more that ſenſe they force from it in à hundred paſſages. What is to be done in this Confuſion? Muſt wee admit of Marcions Bible, or ſubmit to our Sectaries Canon, and new ſenſe alſo? No certainly, it Cannot be expected. Perhaps they will ſay. we are to diſpute the queſtion, and rigidly examin who hath the true Canon and ſenſe of Scripture, They or wee, This ends the difference. Very good. But ſay on I beſeech you? And firſt giue vs à ſure Principle (à doubtful one in ſo weighty à matter help's little) which may bear vp the controuerſy, and at laſt end it, for vnless this principle be agreed on, the reſult of our diſpute will be nothing but à fruitles wrangling. O the Fathers and Antiquity well pondered cannot but decide the debate. I anſwer, may we iudge by the effect, the aſſertion is moſt vntrue:<note place="margin">The ancient Fathers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by ſectaries, end not Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies.</note> For haue not we and Sectaries now read and pondered the Fathers and Antiquity for one whole age, what can be alleged on both ſides, as well for the Canon as the ſenſe, hath been ſaid, and after all, are we not ſtill as much at variance as farr off from ending the controuerſy, as when we began it? Say Now, but vpon à ſolid Principle, who is in fault? The Sectary thinks wee vnderſtand not the Fathers, and we are ſure, he abuſeth them with farr fetch't gloſſes. He ſaith their words are clear for his ſence, and we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the Contrary. Hitherto we come to nothing like à Principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Controuerſy therefore driuen on no further, but to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries bare, <hi>Yea</hi> and our, <hi>No,</hi> hangs yet in the ayre wholly vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. The reaſon is. Though the Fathers words be neuer ſo plain for our Catholick verities, yet after the Sectary hath laid his gloſſes vpon them, they are moſt vnworthily made by him as doubtful, and à matter of as great conteſt, as the very ſenſe of Scripture is, which both of vs would haue cleared by the Fathers teſtimony. That is. There is as much adoe (may Sectaries gloſſes haue place) to vnderſtand, what à Father teaches concerning the ſenſe of ſcripture, as to vnderſtand Scripture it ſelf, before we haue recourſe to the Fathers. To recurre therefore to their interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Controuerted matters whilſt Sectaries as much darken that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102688:62"/> by their gloſſes, as they obſcure the Scripture we diſpute about, is<note place="margin">The matter in Diſpute, no meet Principle to end it.</note> euidently à moſt vnfit way to end any Controuerſy, vnless that which is the very matter of Diſpute between vs, can be ſuppoſed à meet and ſufficient means to end it, which is impoſſible. Now if the ſectary blames vs becauſe we reiect that ſenſe, he drawes from either Scripture or the Fathers, and he alſo reiect ours, what haue we but wrangling? Both parties hitherto only word it, and ſtand chafing at one an other, without Principles. God therefore hath prouided vs à ſurer and eaſier way to end debates about Religion, whereof more in the ſequele Chapters.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Protestant takes away the only means to know true Religion by. His proofs, whether He defend's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy or impugn's Catholick Doctrin, are vnreduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Principles, and neuer goe beyond the weaknes of his own vnproued Aſſertion. Meer gloſſes ſupport all He ſaith, which is euidenced by à brief han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling one Controuerſy, touching the B. Sacrament. Theodoret wrong'd by Sectaries, cleared. His Doctrin is moſt Catholick.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. NOte firſt. If God as I ſaid aboue, once eſtablished true Religion among Chriſtians, He made it ſo diſcernable from all falſe ſects, that it may be found out by prudent reaſon. <hi>Omni literaturâ notius</hi> ſaith Tertull. lib. 1. de Teſtimonio animae. Its more known then any other learning. For to ſay on the one ſide, That an infinite wiſdom hath planted true Religion in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102688:63"/> world, which shall not perish, and on the other, to aſſert it cannot be proued or found out, is firſt to caſt à blemish on Prouidence, and next to free all from the obligation of embracing it, becauſe none can be obliged to embrace that which cannot be known by reaſon, or rational arguments. Note. 2. The Doctrin of Chriſt which eſſentially conſtitutes true Religion, ſtand's moſt firm vpon indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Principles appliable to the Belieuers reaſon. If therefore à Want be found of ſuch proofs, and doubts ariſe, whether Chriſt's Doctrin be taught or no; None can by doubtful or ambiguous<note place="margin">Proofs of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, eaſy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing.</note> Principles only, abſolutly ſay. <hi>This is Chriſts Doctrin,</hi> and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the proofs of true Religion anſwer to the <hi>weightines of the matter,</hi> that is, they are clear, conuincing, and exclude à poſſibility of reaſonable doubting. Thus much ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſay firſt. who euer endeauour's to shew by arguments what Tenents of Religion now held amongſt Chriſtians are pure and Orthodox (when the matter is of Controuerſy,) and cannot<note place="margin">The ſectaries proofs, as dark as his Doctrin.</note> bring his proofs to à Clearer Principle, then the particular aſſertion is which should be proued, argues improbably. The Proteſtant in all the diſcuſſed matters of Religion doth ſo, that is, he neuer goes beyond the ſtrength of his own weak aſſertion, but eludes all by talk wholly as dark and weightles as the very Aſſertion is, which should be proued; therefore he Argues improbably.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To proue the Minor propoſition wherein the difficulty lies. Take à veiw of all our Proteſtant Tenents as they differ from Catholick Doctrin, or Conſtitute this new reformed Religion and ask, what Proteſtant dare appear and venture to proue, That <hi>Faith only iustifies:</hi> The like I ſay of his other negatiue Articles, <hi>Of no real Preſence,</hi> of no <hi>Inuocation of Saints of no Sacrifice of the Maſs.</hi> &amp;c. I abſolutly affirm, He cannot make one of theſe Articles good by any vndoubted Principle, or eſtablish any of them <hi>by à proof which is clearer, than that dark article is, which should be proued.</hi> One reaſon is. Theſe Doctrins oppoſite to the Latin and Greek Church alſo, are not euidently known as truths by the light of<note place="margin">One reaſon of our Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> nature, or by any receiued Principle grounded on Reuelation. No ancient Church reputed Orthodox held them 7. hundred years
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102688:63"/> agone, and Conſequently no vniuerſal tradition is for them. The only difficulty is, whether Holy Scripture or the Fathers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally patronize ſuch Doctrins? And to fauour Sectaries all that's poſſible, we will here moue no doubt of the letter of their Bible, but withall aſſure them, it will be impoſſible to draw ſuch new learning out of that Book, and the <hi>impoſsibility</hi> will be thus mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted. As long as theſe men cannot proue their new Doctrin to be tranſmitted to them from as good and aſſured authority as their book of Scripture is tranſmitted (but vpon less ſure grounds, or less aſſured tradition) ſo long their doctrin is naught and ſtands vnprincipled. But this is ſo, as we shall ſee preſently. And you may by the way note here the difference between the Catholick<note place="margin">The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce beween the proofs of Catholiks and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> and Proteſtant. The firſt, proues euery particular Tenet of his Faith by as ſure à Principle as he proues his Bible to be Diuine, (the Church aſſures him of both) but the Sectary euer fall's short in this and cannot giue you ſo ſtrong à proof for his particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, as he doth for the very letter of his book, which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes teaches that Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But let vs come to the point which chiefly vrgeth, and take one particular Controuerſy (we cannot inſiſt on all) and ask the Proteſtant. How he proues that the real preſence of Chriſts ſacred body (as Catholicks aſſert) is not expreſſed in the literal ſenſe of thoſe words. <hi>This is my body.</hi> His negatiue aſſertion moſt euidently is not there in plain terms. We therefore vrge him to make it good by à proof that's clear or more conuincing than his <hi>own dark and yet vnproued Negatiue is.</hi> And is he not obliged think yee to produce à ſtrong proof indeed, when he hath ſo many powerful Aduerſaries to contraſt with? 1. The clear words of Chriſt now alleged 2. A long Catalogue of moſt ancient Fathers vſually cited by Authors oppoſite to him. 3. The Authority of the Greek and Latin Church, for both Churches mantain the real ſubſtantial preſEnce to this day. 4. The express Doctrin of general Councils, which define our Doctrin poſitiuely, and<note place="margin">The grounds of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</note> condemn the figuratiue preſence of Sectaries 5. Euident Miracles wrought in confirmation of the Myſtery, related by authors of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102688:64"/> moſt indubitable credit. Theſe are no ſlight grounds of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. Let vs ſee by what ſtrong receiued Principle the Sectary endeauour's to weaken them, or (which is immediatly to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) proues his new negatiue <hi>Poſition.</hi> Has he the express letter of Scripture for his Negatiue: <hi>Chriſt is not ſubſtantially preſent in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt?</hi> Not one word in the whole Bible is like it, much contrary. Doth the ſense of Scripture after all places are compared together fauour him? No. What euer ſenſe he drawes from thence ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly to his purpoſe, will be <hi>as obſcure and remote from the nature of à proof or any known Principle,</hi> as his own improbable poſition is, and therefore moſt vnfit to perſwade it. Has he as vniuerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or the vnanimous conſent of Fathers for his negatiue, (or for that ſenſe he would force out of Scripture), as he and we haue for the letter of the Text now cited? Nothing at all. And to show you how iuſtly I propoſe this queſtion, call to mind what Mr:<note place="margin">The Sectary anſwers not to any.</note> Stilling: exact's of his Aduerſary Part. 1. c. 7. P. 216. <hi>If I should,</hi> saith he, <hi>once ſee you proue the infallibility of your Church, the Popes ſupremacy, Inuocation of Saints</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by as vnqueſtionable and vniuerſal tradition as that is whereby we receiue the Scriptures,</hi> I would extoll you for the only perſon that euer did any thing conſiderable on your ſide. Thus he ſpeakes after this precaution giuen. <hi>Think not to fob vs off, with the Tradition of your Church in stead of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik,</hi> with the ambiguous Teſtimonies of two or three Fathers, inſtead of the vniuerſal conſent of the Church ſince the Apoſtles times. Your own words Mr: Stilling: shall here condemn you. The Queſtion is whether your <hi>Negatiue, Chriſt is not really preſent in the Euchariſt,</hi> as Catholiks affirm, be Orthodox Doctrin? We exact as rigid à proof from you, as you demand of vs, but fob vs not off with your own talk (Tradition you haue none) nor with the ambiguous Teſtimonies of two or three Fathers, but giue vs the vniuerſal conſent of the Church ſince the Apoſtles time, as<note place="margin">What we iuſtly require of Sectaries.</note> clear for your negatiue, as you demand of vs for the articles now mentioned; Or if this be too much, giue vs but only the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable ſentiment of any Church, reputed Orthodox, four or fiue hundred years paſt for this your ſenſe and aſſertion, and I will
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102688:64"/> applaud you as à moſt ſingular perſon. But this you shall doe, when you haue turned all faith out of the world; that is neuer. I ſay therefore you haue no more but the ambiguous Teſtimonies of two or three Fathers (nay you haue not ſo much) for this Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Doctrin; which vpon that account proue nothing, <hi>becauſe they are as dark for your ſence,</hi> as the <hi>Doctrin is, which you would proue by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. For example. You may allege ſome paſſages out of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, chiefly that contra Adimant. C. 12. <hi>Our Lord doubted not to ſay, This is my body when he gaue à ſign of his body.</hi> The obuious ſenſe whereof without torturing the Text, is thus. Our Lord gaue vnto his Diſciples the Conſecrated ſpecies and accidents of bread, which were à ſign of his Body <hi>there contained,</hi> and doubted not to ſay, that what he gaue them <hi>vnder thoſe accidents,</hi> was really his body. Let now any one probably inferr, that his<note place="margin">S. Austin's words fauour not Sectaries.</note> ſacred body was not then preſent vnder the accidents of bread, becauſe S. Auſtin ſaith thoſe accidents were à ſign of his body <hi>not abſent,</hi> for à ſign or figure implies not the abſence of the thing ſignified by it. Well, but grant contrary to truth all you can wish, The words at moſt are ambiguous, and therefore no fit Principle to ground an article of faith, as is now noted. You may next allege that known Teſtimony in Theodorets Dialogues. <hi>The Mystical ſignes after the ſanctification recede not from their nature, but remain in their first ſubstance, figure and form; are ſeen and touched as before.</hi> I anſwer, Theoderet plainly ſpeaks of the Myſtical ſignes<note place="margin">More of Theoderet afterward.</note> which are ſeen and touched, not of the inward ſubſtance of bread and wine, which are no immediate obiect of our ſenſes, thoſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes recede not from their nature, but remain in their form and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure as before; and t'is Catholick Doctrin whereof more preſently. But grant the vtmoſt. The words are only dubious and therefore inſufficient to aſſure vs of an article of Faith, when contrary to the receiued Doctrin of the preſent Church. I aſſert yet more. Though any Father should ſay, That the ſubſtance and nature of bread and wine ceaſe not to bee, there is nothing yet concluded againſt vs, for by theſe words <hi>ſubstance</hi> or <hi>nature,</hi> the outward
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102688:65"/> 
                  <hi>Maſsinesse,</hi> or <hi>Corpulency</hi> of bread and wine may be well vnderſtood, which as Theoderet ſaies remain. The reaſon is. In ordinary Speech we often giue to qualities which flow from the eſſence or nature of à thing the very name of the thing it ſelf. Thus we ſay an exceſſiue heat is <hi>fire,</hi> à Maſſy heauiness is lead, or à ſtone, wheras heat and heauiness in common philoſophy, are only natural qualities or properties diſtinct from each ſubſtance, reſpectiuely. Such locutions, were they found, are at moſt dubious, but we ſtand in no need of any far-fetch't gloſſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly Tertullians ſpeech lib. 4. contra Marcio: cap. 39. ex Cap. 21. Lucae contain's no difficulty. <hi>Chriſt taking</hi> bread into his hands and diſtributing it to his Diſciples <hi>made the ſame his body,</hi>

Whoeuer read's Tertullian, will find this to bee the genuine ſenſe of his whole Diſcourſe in the place cited, where firſt he ieer's Marcion. <hi>Faciebat ad vanitatem Marcionis vt panis Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifigeretur,</hi> Then ſaies, Marcion vnderſtand's not, that bread in the old Teſtament was à figure of Chriſt's body, as the Prophet Ierimie ſpeak's. <hi>Conijciamus lignum in panem eius, ſcilicet,</hi> (They are Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian's own words) <hi>Crucem in Corpus eius.</hi> That is à Croſs into his body.

I might firſt anſwer. This ſenſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly flowes from the plain words which we admit, according to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102688:65"/> the rigid grammatical ſignification of euery particular ſentence. But let vs waue this, and ask, whether the contrary ſenſe of ſectaries be any more but meerly their vnproued gloſſes, or thoughts of fancy? I ſay they are ſo, and conſequently as dark, and wholly obſcure, as that Negatiue Propoſition is, which should be proued by them. They ſtorm, and ſay the ſenſe is clear for them, I ſtifly deny it, and aſſert the conttary. They perhaps will vrge me to proue my ſenſe; I vrge them to proue theirs, which cannot be done by the Fathers own words without à ſurer Principle; For, you ſee, the words oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the quarrel, but that which is the cauſe of our diſſentions can neuer end them, or bring vs to any acquieſcency, without à further Principle. And thus we ſtand <hi>Andabatarum more,</hi> winking and fighting. The one ſaies. <hi>Yea,</hi> The other. <hi>No.</hi> without fruit or further progress, and are yet farr from ending diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Now here is that which I would haue all to reflect on, for it is of mighty importance, viz. That controuerſies between the<note place="margin">A reflection neceſſary for all that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies.</note> Catholick and à ſectary, cannot but be an endles work, if both endeauour to decide them by Principles, and vary as much about the ſenſe of thoſe Principles, (which are ſuppoſed to end the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute) as we do about the very matter in queſtion. This is euer ſo, whilſt the ſectary reiect's an infallible Church or her vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Tradition. Obſerue well: The matter now in queſtion is, Whether Chriſt be really preſent in the bleſſed Sacrament? We allege his own Sacred words. The Sectary ſaies we miſtake the ſenſe, and conſequently will not haue the difficulty decided that way. To know the Truth, both of vs examin all the other paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Scripture relating to the Myſtery, both read the originals, and the different verſions, both compare Text and text together, nothing is yet ended; Still we ſtand at variance about the ſenſe, which should decide matters between vs. Next we read the Holy Fathers (for our Sectaries like not Tradition) they produce their<note place="margin">How Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes are made endless.</note> Teſtimonies; we interpret. We produce ours; They alſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret. Obſerue well I ſay. Are we not as much at variance about the ſenſe of theſe Fathers, which are ſuppoſed à Principle to end
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102688:66"/> our debates, as about the very meaning of Gods word? And doth not the matter in queſtion ſtill remain vndecided? Moſt euidently yes. Therefore, vnless ſome other means be afforded whereby we may come more eaſily to the knowledge and belief of the reuealed truth in this Myſtery, (may Sectaries gloſſes haue place) all are caſt into à labyrinth of ſeeking, without hope of finding what God will haue vs to belieue. In à word the plain truth is thus.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Sectaries will haue vs to diſpute of Religion, but on ſuch Terms as shall be ſure neuer to end one difficulty. That is, they will haue vs to reaſon about matters of higheſt conſequence, and with it deſtroy the <hi>beſt ground of all reaſoning.</hi> I ſay therefore. If Religion were to be proued by Scripture only (add to Scripture the authorities of Fathers) when euery one makes that ſenſe of ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re orthodox, which he conceiues to be ſo; Religion ere this day had been long ſince deſtroyed. For the Arian would haue his ſense paſſe for truth, The Pelagian his, The Monothelite his, The Proteſtant his. All theſe different ſenſes admitted, deſtroy the very <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of Chriſtian Religion. And for this reaſon I would fain learn of any knowing man, What that owned Principle is, whereby the Sectary proues the ſenſe he giues of Scripture to be more certainly à reuealed Truth, than that gloſſe is which either Arian or Pelagian forceth out of the very book which Proteſtants read? I aſſert boldly, they are all alike: Gueſſes and meer fancies guide<note place="margin">A iuſt paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel between Arians and Protestants.</note> them, and nothing els. The Arians ſenſe is not clear, no more is the Proteſtants: The Arian has no vniuerſal Tradition for his ſenſe, no more hath the Proteſtant. The Arian has no vniuerſal conſent of Fathers, no more has the Proteſtant. The Arian has no Church euer reputed Orthodox which owned his ſenſe, no more hath the Proteſtant. Now if the Proteſtant recurr to the Primiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue Church, The Arian will go higher to the very Apoſtles preaching, and auouch that his ſenſe was taught by thoſe firſt Maſters of the Goſpel. I ſay it once more, they are all alike, there is no difference between them. The Arians gloſs is as good as the Proteſtants, and the Proteſtants wholly as bad as the Arians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The Proteſtant cannot aduance any thing like à proof in behalf of his own new opinions, and he is as farr from Principles, when he oppoſes Catholick Doctrin. You haue the reaſon giuen already. No proof, leſs ſure than the true ſenſe of Scripture, taught and deliuered by à Church confeſſedly ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.

Next I produced <hi>Brereley</hi> of the Liturgie of the Mass Colain Print 1620. dedicated to our late Soueraign Charles the firſt, then Prince of wales. Tract. 2. Sect. 8.

Hauing peruſed both, the Gentleman wondred his little book paſſed ouer ſo ſlightly the main thing conſiderable in this Dialogue, and that no word of anſwer was returned to the obſeruations of Mr. Brereley, adding, it would do well to make the truth à little better known, which is my intent at preſent.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Firſt, it cannot be doubted, but that the Eutychian<note place="margin">Two Contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry poſitions.</note> Heretick concealed vnder the name of <hi>Eraniſtes,</hi> held our Lords whole Sacred body after his Aſcenſion changed into his Diuinity.

Again, all who haue read the Dialogue know well, that the context to our preſent purpoſe is as followes. After the Orthodox had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his belief of the Holy Euchariſt to be the true body and blood of Chriſt, <hi>Eranistes</hi> the Heretick begin's his plea. <hi>In good time has't thou mentioned theſe Diuine Mysteries, for from them I will shew</hi>

For vpon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he should haue replied. Thou ask'st me what theſe things are after ſanctification?

Thus the Orthodox should haue both anſwered, and excepted againſt his Aduerſary, had Proteſtant Doctrin been in thoſe dayes owned by Chriſtians, but he goes on in à quite different ſtrain, as is already declared. Hence I ſay, this part of the Dialogue is ſo inuincible à proof againſt Proteſtants in behalf<note place="margin">The Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt's Cenſure Theoderet.</note> of the real Preſence that it cannot be anſwered, and therefore the Centuriſt's with other Hereticks quoted by Brereley. pag. 111. and pag. 258. hauing charged S. Chriſoſtome with the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation, cenſure Theoderet vpon the ſame ſcore as one that ſpeak's dangerouſly in the matter. Theſe men it ſeem's, ſaw no great force in the later part of the Dialogue which our modern Proteſtants ſo much vrge, and followes thus.</p>

Dareſt thou <hi>Eraniſtes</hi> ſay, Chriſt's ſacred body retain's yet the ſame exteriour form it had on earth? Has it yet in Heauen the ſame dimenſions, as theſe ſymbols haue after Conſecration?

By what is now ſaid you find Theoderet's diſcourſe moſt ſolid againſt the Heretick, who would needs infer, grounding himſelfe vpon the change made in the Sacrament, that Chriſt's whole humane nature was conuerted into the Diuinity. Thus much ſaith Theoderet, is euidently falſe, for theſe Symbols remain in their <hi>exteriour form,</hi> vnaltered, but Chris'ts humane body with thee remain's not ſo, for all in it, the very exteriour is changed into the Godhead: Therefore thy proof, taken from the ſymbols<note place="margin">Theoderet only ſpeak's of the Species or accidents remaining.</note> of the Sacrament, not changed at all, is void of ſtrength, faint, and weightleſſe. Now that Theoderet ſpeak's only of the outward ſymbols of the Sacrament, is manifeſt. Firſt by what is noted already, where he ſaith we are partakers <hi>of the true body and blood

Obſerue I beſeech you, how the Gentleman to maintain his proofs drawn from ſenſe, is not only forced to reiect the plain ſenſe of Chriſt's words according to the letter. (<hi>This is my body which is giuen for you: This is the Chalice of the new Teſtament, wich is, or shall be shed for you</hi>) But more<note place="margin">Mr Stilling: quarrel's with all Chriſtians, except à ferr Proteſtants.</note> ouer, how he is thrown into à deſperate quarrel wherein he will neuer come off hanſomly; For, he is engaged to make not only the Profeſſors of the Roman and Greek Church, who indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly belieue the Real preſence, more than ſtupid (becauſe oppoſit to that he call's ſenſe and reaſon) but beſides, He contraſt's with à far greater moral body of Chriſtians; I may rightly ſtile it the <hi>Repreſentatiue</hi> of all named Chriſtians in the world, excepting à few Proteſtants.

It is ſo vaſt à Paradox, that though Mr: Stillingſ: should write volumes on this ſubiect, He would neuer ſpeak à probable word againſt ſuch à cloud of witneſſes. You may add

None would haue ventured on ſuch à vaſt improbability but one who either knowes not, or cares not what he ſaies. Now add to theſe the conſent and acknowledgment of the whole Orthodox world, you may iuſtly ſay, it is much harder; or there is more violence offered to mans vnderſtanding in conceiuing, that God who is eſſential Verity (and therefore inclined to preſerue the Church he founded in truth) should permit all thoſe millions of Chriſtians who haue belieued the Real preſence, to be ſo long deceiued in their Faith; than to ſubmit vpon ſo great authority, <hi>to the very myſtery we belieue.</hi>

Now à word to his plea of Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He may ſay. Reaſon tell's me there is bread ſtill after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration.

Either the now quoted Fathers and the Church alſo, haue moſt impiouſly betrayed Chriſts cauſe in deliuering falſe Doctrin contrary to ſenſe and reaſon, or worthily defended à Chriſtian verity; Grant this ſecond, we haue our intent.

Therefore if we be in errour, the wit of man cannot vnbeguile vs vpon rational proofs and Principles. And here I vrge Mr Silling: to bring to light his contrary Principles as full and ſignificant (that is, Scripture as clear, Fathers as clear, Tradition as clear, the Iudgement of ſome owned Orthodox Church as clear and vndoubted) for the opinion he hold's, as we now alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in the defenſe of our Catholick verity, Belieue it, if he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as he certainly doth, the Church to haue erred ſo groſly for à thouſand years, The Fathers to haue beguiled the world with their miſtaken and moſt improper expreſſions on this ſubiect, when they meant no ſuch thing; He ought to faſten vpon ſound Principles indeed before we yeild; and muſt not think to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw<note place="margin">What ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are obliged to.</note> our Doctrin or foile vs, with à few gleanings pick't here and there out of antiquity, ſet forth with à hundred falſe and fancied gloſſes.

I am aſtonished to read this, and anſwer briefly. Chriſt's Reſurrection, (the like I ſay of Miracles) was moſt vndoubted vpon the diſcouery which ſense and reaſon made in the preſence of ſuch obiects, becauſe no contrary Principle, ſo much as weakly, ſtood againſt that euidence, and therefore reaſon could no more doubt of what was obiected to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, then I now doubt of writing theſe lines. But all is contrary in the preſent Myſtery. For here the vnanswerable words of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, the Authority of my Church, the Clear Teſtimonies of Fathers, the voice and vote of Chriſtianity force ſubmiſſions on me to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the Diuine Reuelation, which is either certainly known vpon theſe grounds, or we boldly ſay, no Chriſtian verity was euer yet known vpon any ſure Principle.<note place="margin">What, if ſectaries deny Church authority and explicate the Fathers?</note>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Perhaps Mr Stilling: may roundly grant, that the Greek and Latin Church erred in this Doctrin of the real preſence for many ages, and conſequently that innumerable learned Doctors haue not only been beſotted them ſelues, but moreouer haue ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely drawn millions of Chriſtians into à damnable hereſy of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that to be Chriſts body, which really is not: Howeuer, he will honour the Fathers ſo far, as to afford them the fauour of his gloſſes. Contra 1. If the Church and all Chriſtians erred ſo vaſt à time in profeſſing this Doctrin, Mr Stilling: is obliged to name ſome Churh reputed Orthodox. 3. or 4. hundred years paſt (for then there was à true Church in the world) which held his opinion, or as expreſly denyed the real Preſence, as our Church, both then, and now mantains it, and this will coſt him more pains than to writ an other Account of Proteſtancy, for I am ſure there was neuer any ſuch Church on earth. Contra. 2. If He interpret's the<note place="margin">The Church and Fathers ſpeak alike of this Myſtery.</note> Fathers, He may as well interpret our Church Doctrin, and make all belieue, that we Catholicks hold not yet the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Obſerue the ſame language in all. <hi>That wich in ſeen is not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102688:76"/> bread, though it ſeem's ſo to the taſt, But the body of Chriſt. Our ſenſe may be deceiued, Gods word cannot deceiue vs. The bread indeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> made the flesh of Chriſt, and the wine his blood</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deliuer their ſenſe. and it is the Churches language alſo. If therefore Mr Stilling: can ſo gloss theſe words of the Fathers, as to make them ſpeak Proteſtancy, or not to deliuer our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrin, I should not wonder, if in the next book ſet forth he aduentures to draw the very Definitions of the Council of Trent to his Proteſtant opinion of no real preſence. If he did ſo, I am ſure his attempt would proue as vnſuccesful in the one caſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the other.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Well. But permit him to interpret the Fathers, and to fall foule as he is wont to do, vpon our ſuppoſed Church errours; what is the vtmoſt that followes? Thus much only. Meer talk without Principles. For I ask vpon what Principle may I or any know, that his gloſſes (which ſtriue to dead the very, obuious ſenſe of the Fathers plain words) implie not altogether as little ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as little aſſurance, as the very Doctrin doth which he would defend by it? If ſo (and ſo it is moſt euidently) as his Doctrin before his gloſſes was improbable to the reſt of Chriſtians, ſo his interpretations goe no higher, but are euery whit as impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
               <p n="12">12. I muſt therefore tell Mr Stilling: that vnless his expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation<note place="margin">Sectaries gloſſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled, worth No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> of Scripture and Fathers rely on à certain Principle <hi>disti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>This is my body.</hi> My Church tell's me the literal ſenſe is true. The Fathers as you haue heard, and the Tradition of two Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> confirm this ſenſe: Now comes Mr Stillingfleet and firſt reiect's my Churches authority, then begins to ſtrain the Fathers Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies with his gloſſes. Stay, Sr, ſay I. I except againſt your glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and iuſtly ask whether they are true or Counterfeit Coyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> If true, they ſtand vpon Principles now briefly hinted at. Proue this and I'le reuerence your gloſſes, but if you fail (and fail you
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102688:76"/> muſt) your Doctrin and gloſſes are both alike Counterfeit, and thoughts of fancy only.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Hee may reply. When Proteſtants cite, the Fathers againſt the Real preſence, For example, That of <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> or <hi>Theode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> mentioned aboue, we Catholicks explicate them, and now (which ſeem's foul play) we except againſt his Gloſſes, For, If we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret,<note place="margin">An Obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> why may not Hee doe ſo alſo? A word only in paſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to what is noted aboue. If to decide this one Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy of Chriſt's Real Preſence, recourſe be had to the Fathers, and the two aduerſe Parties do no more but load ſuch Teſtimonies as are alleged with their priuate interpretations, the Diſpute will neuer be ended, Becauſe priuate gloſſes leaue the two Diſſenters as much at iarrs as they were before: God therefore, as I haue often ſaid, affords an eaſier means to know his reuealed Truths. Now my Anſwer to the obiection is. The Catholick then only blames the Proteſtant's wilful interpretation, when it sham fully out-faces, the clear words of à Father, and when the Gloſſer has no vndu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable Principle diſtinct from his gloſs wheron to ſettle his Doctrin, as he has not in our preſent Controuerſy. Obſerue well. The Fathers ſay, <hi>What wee ſee is not bread, but Chriſts very body.</hi> The Sectary interpret's. <hi>That wee ſee is not common bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but Christs</hi> body <hi>Figuratiuely</hi> or <hi>Sacramentally.</hi> The Fathers ſay, it is not <hi>figuratiuely</hi> only, but really his body. So Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact<note place="margin">Anſwered, and the reaſon giuen.</note> and S. Iohn Damaſcen cited aboue. Had the Sectary who interpret's thus, an vndoubted Reuelation for his Gloss, deliuered by any Oracle of Truth, Scripture, Traditions or Orthodox Church, there would be good reaſon to giue him hearing, But when we euidently ſee, that the beſt and only proof of his Doctrin is no more, but the very gloss he makes, without Further Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we iuſtly except againſt him, and hold ſuch gloſſes impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now all is contrary with the Catholick who neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret's any Authority but when t'is dubious, and if it be ſo, it <hi>neither help's the Sectary,</hi> nor <hi>hurts the Catholick,</hi> and therefore ought In reaſon to be caſt aſide as either impertinent, or as weak and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102688:77"/> forcelesse in all diſputes of Controuerſies. The fundamental<note place="margin">Chriſt's Doctrin not proued by gloſſes, or any ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> Reaſon already hinted at, is. The true Doctrin of Chriſt, is not proued by Gloſſes or any doubtful Teſtimony, but ſtand's moſt firm vpon known and indubitable Principles (or, if in order to Chriſtians it want's ſuch ſupports, it cannot pass for Chriſt's Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin). An ambiguous Teſtimony therefore which ſeemingly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes this true Doctrin <hi>Certainly Principled,</hi> is moſt impertinently alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt any Tenet of our known and owned Catholick Faith.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Vpon this one ſole ground now clearly laid forth, I confidently Affirm, all Controuerſies in Religion might be eaſily ended, would Sectaries pleaſe to lay Preiudice aſide, and follow manifeſt reaſon. I'le shew you how. Write down firſt the two contrary Tenents of Catholicks and Proteſtants. <hi>Christ is really and ſubſtantially preſent in the Euchariſt. Chriſt is not really and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially preſent.</hi> Next examin well the Principles wheron theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrins rely or are ſuppoſed to rely. The Catholick vrgeth firſt, Chriſt's plain words. 2. The Authority of his Church and ſaith, his Churches Doctrin is the very ſame that Christ words literally taken, express. 3. He ponder's the clear Testimonies of<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:</note> Fathers, and diſcourſes thus. When I find the moſt ſignificant expreſſions of Fathers conſonant to our Sauiour's plain words, and to the owned Doctrin of my Church, I muſt aſſuredly reſt on theſe, as indubitable grounds, or Confess, that There neither is or was euer any Principle for the ſoundeſt Article of Chriſtian Faith. Examin next the Sectaries Principles. Has He any words in Scripture as clear as mine, or to this ſenſe? <hi>This is not my body, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Name<note place="margin">Sectaries haue none ſuch.</note> ſuch à Church, He will ſpeak's to the purpoſe. Has he Fathers ſo numerous, ſo express and clear, for his <hi>Signe</hi> and <hi>figure only,</hi> as the few Teſtimonies now alleged are in behalf of Catholick Doctrin? If he haue let him pleaſe to produce them. I'le doe no more but lay my Teſtimonies by them, and if after the peruſal, or à iuſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102688:77"/> Parallel made of both, All the world iudges not thoſe I <hi>quote,</hi> to be moſt conuincing (may the literal ſenſe ſtand) and his both dark and ambiguous, I will vndergoe any Cenſure. You haue heard how loud and express the Teſtimonies briefly hinted at, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable more are for our Catholick Verity. I challenge Mr Stilling: to Confront them with others as openly ſignificant for his opinion. I verily think he will neuer goe about to doe what is deſired, but fob vs off with killing flies, and no man knowes what.</p>
               <p n="16">16. In the <hi>interim</hi> I Argue. I am either obliged to renounce<note place="margin">An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from our Catholick Principles.</note> the obuious ſence of theſe Authorities which I ſee euidently Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the words of Scripture, and to the Doctrin of my Church; or, by force of theſe Proofs am ſtill to belieue as I doe. Grant this ſecond, I ſtand on ſecure ground: But, if I am obliged to renounce the obuious ſenſe of Chriſts words, my Church Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, and the expreſſions of theſe Fathers &amp;c. Our Aduerſaries are bound, if à ſpark of Charity liues in their Hearts, to plead by ſtronger Principles which may ſettle me in an abſolute Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of my Doctrin, and withdraw me from the ſuppoſed er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour I liue in. Is not this iuſtice and Charity think ye? And is not the Compliance moſt eaſy? For, if their Doctrin be Chriſt's Doctrin, and mine not, Theirs ſtand's, as I now told you, vpon clear and indubitable Principles, And Principles of that nature are eaſily laid forth to euery ordinary vnderſtanding. Now I ſubſume: But it is euident, the Sectary hath no ſuch conuincing Principles, which can oblige me to renounce the plain literal ſenſe of Chriſts words and the Fathers already cited. And this I proue. What euer Principle obliges me to renounce, or to deny the plain literal ſenſe of ſuch words, muſt giue aſſurance, that thoſe expreſſions literally<note place="margin">Why none can remoue me from our Catholick Tenet.</note> vnderſtood are dangerous, and apt to induce Chriſtans into gross errour, for if literally taken, they do no miſchief, or be not apt to induce into dangerous errour, why should I Deny their obuious ſenſe, becauſe Ptoteſtants will haue me do ſo? But there is no Principle ſo much as meanly probable, whereby theſe expreſſions are proued falſe or inductiue into dangerous Errour; for were this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102688:78"/> really ſo, ſome Church or Author of Credit, would long ſincé haue noted their ouer much vehemency, in ſayng more then was true concerning this Myſtery, which none euer yet did. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may ſtill and without Reproof hold where I am, and adhere to their literal Doctrin, which my Church teaches.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Some may teply. Sectaries vrge vs not ſo crudely to reiect the Fathers Teſtimonies, as only to moderate or rectify their ſenſe by the help of our Modern mens gloſſes, which is à blamles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, for we do ſo with Gelafius and other Authors when they ſeemingly make againſt our Doctrin, and Proteſtants do no more. Anſw. Proteſtants do more, for their interpretations euer imply à peremptory and abſolute denial of that very literal ſenſe which the Father words expreſs. For example S. Cyril ſaith. Catech.

That as water was really changed into wine at Cana in Galilee, ſo wine was really and ſubſtantially changed into Chriſts blood. Sectaries as peremptorily deny this real and <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> change of wine into blood, as if one should now deny the Real and ſubſtantial change of that water into wine. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they renounce both the parity, and open ſenſe of the words, And, (which is euer to be noted), wilfully do ſo, when they haue nothing like à ſure Principle diſtinct from their gloſs to <hi>ground their denial on.</hi> Contrariwiſe, the Catholick in this debate denies no expreſs ſenſe of any Fathers Teſtimony, but only makes Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the Signification of words, which are confeſſedly dubious. Take here one inſtance <hi>Gelaſius</hi> ſaith. The ſubſtance or nature of bread and wine ceaſe not to be. Firſt I make no account of this Gelaſius, Author of the book <hi>De duobus naturis Christi. Contra Eutich:</hi> He was not that holy Pope ſo called, but rather Gelaſins <hi>Cizicenus</hi> as Bellarmine notes de <hi>Scriptoribus Eccl:</hi> Howeuer theſe two particles <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> may, <hi>ex placito,</hi> indifferently ſignify either the <hi>inward ſubſtance</hi> or <hi>outward Maſsineſſe</hi> of bread and wine, for natural qualities which flow from an Eſſence, haue, or often ſuſtain, as was noted aboue, the name of that Eſſence they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102688:78"/> come from. Now the Catholick renounceth no obuious ſenſe, but only contends that <hi>Nature and ſubſtance</hi> may ſignify, as is moſt<note place="margin">Of Gelaſius. How much his authority is worth.</note> vſual, the outward corpulent forms of bread and wine which ceaſe not to be, And he giues this ſignification to theſe two words, becauſe Scripture Church and the Fathers, wheron his Doctrin irrefragably depends, forceth him to it, And he doth well when it cannot be proued by any probable Principle that Gelaſius relates to the inward ſubſtance of bread and wine. Thus much may be ſaid, if that authority were worth any thing. Read, I beſeech, you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reley, <hi>In his Lyturgy of the Maſſe</hi> cited aboue pag: 259. you shall find there this Authority moſt exactly examined, and that in very truth, this Gelaſius who euer he was, ſpeaking againſt the Euti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians as Theoderet did, vndeniably defends our Catholick Doctrin of the Real preſence and Tranſubſtantiation alſo. Open the book and read, you will be ſatisfyed. I cannot dwell longer on theſe long ſince defeated Obiections.</p>
               <p n="18">18. There is yet an other Reply. Sectaries may ſay, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all this while Scripture and Fathers clear for our Catholick Doctrin. The Suppoſition is denied, becauſe they quote (t'is true not many) but ſome Fathers and Scripture alſo, to countenance their new opinion. By the way here is occaſion again, to reflect on what is often noted. viz. We quote Scripture and Fathers, and they explicate all; They cite alſo; and we do the like; and if nothing but à Return of explications thus pass from one to the other, we are as much iarring as we were before, without hope of ending Controuerſies this way. Now my Anſwer to the firſt part of the Obiection is. We Catholicks ſuppoſe nothing, but only<note place="margin">The anſwer to an other reply.</note> take the very words of Scripture and Fathers in à literal ſenſe, and ſay their expreſſions are exactly conformable to the Doctrin of the Roman Catholick Church, which was neuer cenſured by any Orthodox ſociety of Chriſtians. Vpon theſe Principles therefore, <hi>Scripture, Church,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> we ſtand immoueable. To that which followes I Anſwer. Sectaries haue not one ſyllable of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in fauour of their Nouelty (and to omit à rehearſal of thoſe triuial Arguments drawn from certain paſſages, where they conceiue
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102688:79"/> the Sacrament is called <hi>bread</hi> the <hi>fruit</hi> of the vine &amp;c.) I conuince my Aſſertion by the poſitiue ground abready eſtablished, which none shall ouerthrow. If this be the true ſenſe of Scripture, when<note place="margin">An Argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment which Sectaries Cannot ſolue.</note> it ſpeaks of the Bleſſed Sacrament. <hi>Christ who is aboue in heauen is not really preſent on the Altar, but in his ſign only,</hi> Or, that the bread after Conſecration is really what it was before natural bread, only deputed to à holy vſe; If this, I <hi>ſay,</hi> be the true ſenſe of Gods word, Chriſts Orthodox Church expreſly deliuered it to Chriſtians as the true meaning of the Holy Ghoſt ſome few ages before Luthers Reuolt, for then their was an Orthodox Church on earth: But no Orthodox Church then taught ſo, or ſenſed Scripture as Sectaries do now, Therefore vnless that Church was ignorant and knew not the meaning of Scripture, or Malicious, and concealed it from Chriſtians, our Sectaries ſenſe is not Scripture. To confirm this Reaſon. All know, that the Roman Catholick Church then, as well as now, abſolutly renounced the ſenſe which Sectaries force out of Scripture, and for that cauſe was not (ſay they) Orthodox in this particular Doctrin, but no other Church confeſſedly Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, taught it at that time, Therefore, it was not thought the Scriptures true meaning. All I would ſay is briefly laid forth thus.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The true Church of Chriſts euer deliuers the true ſenſe of Scripture at leaſt in weighty and fundamental Matters, ſo much Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants grant, But, No true Church deliuered this their ſenſe three or four ages before Luthers reuolt, Ergo it was not the true meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, but à whimsy lately inuented. This Argument I hold demonſtratiue. You will perhaps ask, What is that theſe men can pretend to, hauing neither Scripture nor Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church to rely on? I'le tell you in à word. They allege<note place="margin">How Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour te ſolue it.</note> firſt two or three weak and ambiguous Sentences of Fathers, which the Catholick admit's, not in the ſenſe of Nouelliſts, yet according to the clear plain and obuious ſignification of words, as is now declared, and He prudently giues this ſignification to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous words, becauſe the Doctrin he owns ſtand's firm vpon other indubitable Principles, <hi>Scripture, Church,</hi> and <hi>Fathers.</hi> The
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102688:79"/> Sectary euidently wants ſuch Principles, and therefore vapors as well as he can with à few moſt weak and vnconcluding Authorities. The next thing relyed on, is much worſe and purely nothing but fancy. He reads Scripture and thoſe euident Teſtimonies of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as manifeſt for our Church Doctrin as it is clear that the Church teaches it) and theſe, forſooth, he endeauours to obſcure by à number of his own improbable gloſſes, without the leaſt shadow of any diſtinct Principle, which giues ſo much as à Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to his fancied interpretations.

                  <p>Mr: Stillingfleet groſly abuſeth the Fathers that aſſert the Real Preſence. His vnprincipled gloſſes are not only dubious and therefore worth nothing, but moreouer highly improbable.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THough I am very loath to ſpend time on trifles and as vnwilling to catch flies, as Mr Stilling: is to kill them, (T'is his own phraſe) yet I muſt do ſo in ſome meaſure, or permit à number of foule improbabilities to pass vnexamined, which are laid forth in à pretended <hi>Rational account of Proteſtancy.</hi> I shall only entertain you with à few of the Groſſer ſort, wauing many of leſſer moment, and I doe thus much to defend à Chriſtian Verity which my very Soul Adores, For I am well aſſured, If our belief of Chriſt's real Preſence in the Euchariſt be an errour, Chriſt and his Church and innumerable Fathers alſo, haue deceiued vs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One Authority alleged againſt Mr. Stillingfleet, you haue in his own page 568. And t'is à known paſſage of S. Cyprian <hi>de Caena Dmi,</hi> or of ſome other Author not much inferiour to him, if we belieue Mr Fulk againſt the Rhem's Teſtament. In 1. Cor. 11.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102688:80"/> and Eraſmus his Annotations vpon S. Cyprian, Baſil print anno<note place="margin">S. Cyprians Authority, examined.</note> 1558. fol. 287. Mr Stilling: contend's it is of à later Date, yet is pleaſed by an Addition of his gloſſes to vnſenſe the words as well as he can, and at laſt make them to ſpeak Proteſtancy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Authors words are Theſe. <hi>This common bread changed into flesh and blood giues life. The bread which our lord gaue to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples being Changed. Non effigie ſed naturâ, not in outward form or ſemblance, but in its inward nature or ſubstance, by the Omnipotency of the word, is made flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Mr Stilling: Aſſerts all this proues not Tranſubſtantiation, first, becauſe the Author Saith Christs words. <hi>Vnless ye eate the flesh</hi>

                  <hi>and drink the blood of the ſon of God, you shall haue no life in you,</hi> are not to be vnderſtood after à Carnal ſenſe. Anſw: That's true, yet your Inference, Sir, is moſt improbable. The Principle you muſt rely on, is. None are to think as the Capharnits did, witness S. Auſtin, that they were to cut into pieces Chriſts Sacred flesh, and eate that as we do Common meats, And your inference ill deduced run's thus. <hi>Therefore the inward ſubſtance of bread is not changed into his body.</hi> This inference, I ſay, is null, for both theſe are eternal truths and well conſist together. <hi>Bread is changed into Christs body, yet we neither cut that body à pieces</hi> or eate it, as the Capharnits grosſly imagined.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He argues again and more improbably. This Author (ſaith he) by the effects attributed to the Sacrament, calling it<note place="margin">His ſecond Argument, more ſlight.</note> food which nourished to immortallity, cannot poſſibly be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſpeak if Christ's Corporal preſence, <hi>becauſe we Catholicks confeſs Christs body remain's no longer in our body, then the Accidents of bread and wine are there.</hi> I verily think the man was buſied with other thoughts when he wrot theſe lines. For what ſenſe haue we here? Christ's Sacred body really preſent giues grace and is no longer preſent then the Accidents of bread and wine remain, <hi>Ergo,</hi> bread and wine are not Really changed into his body. This I ſay is à moſt improbable inference. For the effects of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which imply the production of Grace, may and muſt ſtand with Chriſt's real Preſence, though that production of grace
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102688:80"/> Sacramentally giuen, laſt's no longer then his Bleſſed body is vnder the forms of bread and wine.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But an other doughty Argument is drawn out of S. Cyprian's words, which Mr. Stilling: cites in his Margent. <hi>Sed immortalitatis alimonia datur à Communibus cibis differens, corporalis ſubſtantiae retinens ſpeciem, ſed virtutis diuinae inuiſibili efficientiâ probans ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">His third Argument proues nothing.</note> And He vnworthyly renders them thus in English. That immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Nourishment is giuen vs which differs from common food, that it retain's the <hi>Nature</hi> of à <hi>Corporeal ſubstance,</hi> but prouing the preſence of à Diuine power by its inuiſible efficiency. <hi>So that,</hi> ſaith he, what preſence of Diuine power is there, is shewed in regard of the effects of it, not in regard of any ſubſtantial change of the bread into the body of Chriſt. Sr, I vtterly deny your proofleſſe, <hi>So That,</hi> and ſay your deduction is more then improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This Author ſaith expreſly common bread changed into flesh, by the omnipotency of the word giueth life and immortal nourishment, which is Diuine grace, and therefore the Diuine power appeares in both, firſt in the ſubſtantial change of bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſts body, next in the effect, or production of grace in à worthy Receiuer, and you improbably conclude, it shewes it ſelf in regard of the effects only.</p>

This fained Sacramental change in the Sacrament is only Moral, and extrinſecal, Therefore ſuch inſtances are to no purpoſe. For can you make this probable inference?

Doth finally this your Obiectiue preſence imply only thus much, that Chriſt by his power (though really abſent) work's the ſame effects in à worthy Receiuer, as if he were actually

No. For he works the ſame effects, and (though ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) produceth grace by the Sacrament of Baptiſm as if he were preſent, dare you Therefore ſay he is in as peculiar à manner Really preſent, <hi>in</hi> and <hi>with the water</hi> of Baptiſm, as he is in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <hi>in and with bread and wine?</hi> Yet more.

And thus, Sr, you ſee how impoſſible it is to giue your poor Belieuers any thing like à Real obiect, which may be called à <hi>true Real Preſence;</hi> though I hold you obliged to help both them and me to à clear Notion of it: Becauſe Chriſt's Sacred body and blood are Real things, you attribute to theſe two Real things à <hi>true real Preſence in and with bread and wine</hi> (which cannot but denominate <hi>them really preſent</hi> with theſe two Subſtances vpon the Altar) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are obliged to tell me, what that is <hi>A parte rei,</hi> which I once more ſay, is impoſſible; For, as your Sacramental preſence, in your ſenſe, is à word no man vnderſtand's, ſo your Doctrin is as wholy vnintelligible.

                  <hi>Christ, according to his own word.</hi> Hence you infer, it is plain, <hi>He ſpeaks of à Sacramental preſence, for he doth not oppoſe the body and blood of Christ to the ſubſtance of bread and wine, but to meer bread, id est, That they should not look on the bread and wine as naked ſignes, but as Signa efficacia</hi> or efficacious ſignes. Anſw. Firſt The Saint has not à Syllable of either <hi>Signes</hi> or <hi>Signae efficacia.</hi> Next, your Speculation about <hi>meer bread,</hi> is à meer nothing.

Now to what you Add of à few chief Articles neceſſary to be belieued and no more, I anſwer firſt. Your Scripture ſaith no ſuch Thing, nor tell's me or you which Articles are neceſſary, which not, and if it did ſo, you are only where you were before in darkness, Since you proue not ſo much as one of theſe few Articles to be of Diuine Reuelation, <hi>but by the book which records them;</hi> And this you do whilſt I iuſtly queſtion not only the book, but the Truth of this very article, which you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke Diuine, <hi>becauſe it is in your Bible.</hi> But enough of this ſubiect at preſent, whereof ſee more C. 9. n. 7.

For example. Scripture neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly denies Tranſubſtantiation with the Proteſtant, nor in that <hi>plain open Term</hi> affirm's it with the Catholick: it neither clearly Saies there are Two Sacraments only, nor in expreſs Words allowes of Seuen: It neither clearly denies Purgatory, nor vnder that <hi>express word</hi> aſſerts it.

It is impoſſible. The Reaſon is, it cannot determine that whereof it ſpeaks not clearly, nor become an intellectual <hi>Rule,</hi> or Meaſure whereby we are to iudge what's true, or what's falſe concerning theſe controuerſies, if it Meddles not with them in expreſs Terms.

It is hard to ſay what they driue at, For if all this pretended clarity diffuſed it ſelf through euery paſſage of Holy writ, worſe it is for them, and to their vtter confuſion. Obſerue My reaſon.

Thus much ſeem's clear. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will ask why I inſtance in an <hi>Vnbelieuer,</hi> who is yet to chuſe his Religion? When I should show that Chriſtians, euen thoſe we call Sectaries, ought not to end Controuerſies or to regulate their Faith by the apparent eaſines, or difficulty of Myſteries within the bounds of Chriſtianity, whereof many are in diſpute between them and Catholicks. Anſw. I haue inſtanced thus on ſet purpoſe to lay open the great Errour of all Sectaries, who leauing the<note place="margin">Theſe who yet belieue nothing and Sectaries, are alike in their Choiſe Of Religion.</note> Conduct of Chriſt's Church run along with this <hi>ſuppoſed Vnbelieuer.</hi> For as he, after à conſideration had of ſeueral Myſteries found in the Religions now named, takes out of each what is eaſieſt, and beſt likes his Fancy, or weak reaſon; So Sectaries ptoceed, Though they walk in à leſſer compass, and for the moſt part limit Themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to ſomething taught by men called Chriſtians, whether true or falſe, imports not. Within ſuch bounds they take and leaue as freely what pleaſeth, as any <hi>Vnbelieuer</hi> doth, and vſually throw off Myſteries moſt difficult to ſenſe and Reaſon. Thus the Arian reiect's à Trinity becauſe it is à hard Myſtery, and not plainly expreſſed in Scripture. The Pelagian denies Original ſin vpon the ſame ground, and Proteſtants thunder againſt <hi>Tranſubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe the word is not in Holy Writ, and the Myſtery ſeem's repugnant to their Reaſon. All therefore are alike as ill Self-chuſers with in ſuch à compass as any Vnbelieuer, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes à new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion on his own head, guided by no other Rule, but fancy, or what ſeem's to him reaſonable. The ſole cauſe of this Self-chuſing, is the Sectaries falling off from the conduct of Chriſts vnerring Oracle, <hi>The Church,</hi> which tell's them what God ſpeak's. This vnfortunately ſlighted, They make him ſpeak iuſt ſo much as they think fit, or ſeem's good to their weak and fallible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:102688:97"/>2. The next Principle, Sectaries may lay hold on for à ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, or at leaſt à Subordinate and concurrent means to decide Controuerſies, and regulate Faith, is the Authority of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers. Though Catholiks highly honour theſe great <hi>Lights</hi> of the Church, And no way decline the tryal, yet they<note place="margin">Proteſtants doe and muſt except againſt the Authority of Fathers.</note> think an eaſier Rule can be aſſigned for all, and know well that Proteſtants doe and muſt except againſt this very Rule. One ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is. The labour is immenſe to peruſe exactly the large volumes of Fathers (the like is of Councils) which can only be done by the more learned of different Religions. Howeuer, ſuppoſe the work performed by à learned Catholick and à learned Proteſtant, and that both diligently read the Fathers, The ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction giuen to the Generality of other Chriſtians is very little or nothing, who firſt muſt Hear, what Theſe two men report, and next credit their diſſenting Iudgements. And can ſuch iudgement think ye thus at variance (as they haue been for à hundred years) certainly regulate Diuine Faith in à Seeker after truth, or end debates wheron Saluation depend's? It is impoſſible.

               <p n="3">3. I ſay. The Fathers that are not only fallible, but alſo ſuppoſed by Sectaries to haue actually wronged Truth, can be no Appendant or ſubordinate, much less any ſufficient Rule of faith for them, when theſe conceited Errours are ſo numerous<note place="margin">Recourſe to Fathers in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant.</note> That all along they ſtick moſt Cloſe to our Catholick Doctrin, as is largely proued in the Proteſtants <hi>Apology.</hi> Some perhaps will ſay we muſt haue recourſe to ſuch paſſages of Fathers as only treat of Fundamentals, and ſo farr are vnexceptionably plain: Anſw. what need of this, when Proteſtants ſay there is no great difference between vs in Fundamentals? But ſuppoſe this done, which yet cannot be done, whilſt Sectaries remain in their wonted Labyrinth concerning <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> what light haue we from theſe Fathers to try controuerſies now in Agitation, when they grant that Popery is made vp of the Fathers Errours?

And becauſe it mainly import's firſt, to diſcouer their want of Euidence and next their fallacious proceeding in this particular, I will briefly do both and remit all here noted to the prudent Cenſure of euery Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader. Thus it is.

To proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute all or the half he has, would make this Treatiſe as big as his volume. We begin with that known Paſſage of S. <hi>Hierome. Epiſt. 57. Ad Damaſum,</hi> where the Saint ſaith. <hi>The Church is built vpon S. Peters See, and whosoeuer is out of the Communion of that Church</hi> (whereof <hi>Pope Damaſus</hi> was then head) <hi>is Prophane, an
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102688:100"/> Alien, and belongs to Antichrist</hi> &amp;c. This in brief is the Subſtance of <hi>S. Hieroms Doctrin.</hi> Mr Stilling: Part 2. C. 1. P. 311. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes not plainly theſe Expreſſions to <hi>heat</hi> or <hi>flattery,</hi> although,<note place="margin">S. Hierome abuſed.</note> Saith he, it <hi>look's the more ſuſpicious, becauſe at that time</hi> S. <hi>Hierome had à great picque againſt the</hi> Eaſtern Bishops, And then tell's vs to no purpoſe, what occaſioned the Quarrel. Reflect good Reader. Is this hanſom, to make à Saint and moſt profound Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to Speak in ſo weighty à Matter againſt Truth, and his own conſcience, moued therunto by <hi>flattery</hi> and no man knowes what Imagined <hi>Picques?</hi> Suppoſe he earneſtly ſtood for Truth againſt thoſe Bishops, muſt He Therefore be thought either to flatter or to deny truth now, when he writ's to à Pope, his lawful Superiour? Vpon what Principle doth this vngrounded calumny Stand? Pray you Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After ſome Parergons, not worth the mentioning. Mr Stilling: Saies. <hi>When S. Hierome Pronounces thoſe Aliens and Prophane,</hi> who are out of the Communion of the Church, it either belongs not to the particular Church of Rome, or if it doth, it makes not to our purpoſe. What mean theſe words, <hi>The particular Church of Rome?</hi> The ſole Diocess of that Citty? No. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeak's of the Church built vpon <hi>S. Peter,</hi> or of all Churches vnited in Faith with that <hi>See,</hi> where Damaſus then ſate, which <hi>only</hi> (excluding <hi>Aliens,</hi> That is all heretical Societies) make vp the true Vniuerſal Orthodox Church, as shall be demonſtrated hereafter. Well ſaith Mr Stilling: Suppoſe I grant that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpake of the particular Church of Rome (he means, or t'is Nonſenſe, of all Churches of the ſame Faith with the Roman) yet this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes not home to the purpoſe, vnless we Catholicks proue our Church to be as Orthodox now, as She was in thoſe Primitiue times. <hi>We proue,</hi> Good Sr. Proue you on God's name, to<note place="margin">Mr Stilling: demand impertinent.</note> whom prouing belong's, That this Church is less Orthodox now, than formerly. Who euer ſtand's in à known old path as we Doe, ought not to proue he ſtand's there, (<hi>Olim poſsideo prior poſsider,</hi> is his proof) but one that ſtart's aſide, and takes to à new way (as you haue done) should tell vs, why he left the other high
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102688:100"/> 
                  <hi>Road</hi> wherein his Anceſtors walked? No prince proues his <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to à Rebel, but if any be ſo vngracious as to rebel, that man muſt show why he did ſo, or ſuffer for it. But of this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biect ſo much is ſaid in the other Treatiſe that I hold it vnans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable, More shall be added in its due place. In the mean while you ſee à pretty way of arguing, which run's vpon an idle Suppoſition. viz. That the Roman Church is altered from it ſelf, ſince S. Hieroms time. The improbable Suppoſition is firſt to be proued, before the Argument haue any force, till then we may lawfully iudge, that S. Hierom's Teſtimony concludes againſt this Aduerſary. Pray tell me, If I, vpon à bare Suppoſition, should aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that Mr Stilling: is no good Diuine, and thence infer, he is<note place="margin">His falſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſition not proued.</note> vnfit to write Controuerſies, might he not moſt iuſtly be angry, and well deny my Aſſertion, becauſe the Suppoſition whereon the Aſſertion ſtand's is not proued? No more, ſay is t'is proued in the preſent Matter. viz. <hi>That our Church Doctrin is altered from it ſelf ſince the primitiue times.</hi> Proue that vpon ſound Principles, and you will doe more then Euer Proteſtant did hitherto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence all Mr Stilling: following talk of Paralogiſms fall's to nothing. It is he ſaith, our perpetual <hi>Paralogiſm,</hi> when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are cited in praiſe of the Church of Rome <hi>although ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes their Rhetorick swell'd too high in their Encomiaſticks,</hi> (They are his words) That we will needs haue theſe praiſes to be vnderſtood as well of that Church in our preſent age, as in the Fathers time when it better deſerued them; And he add's. <hi>As though, it were not poſsible for à Church to be eminent for purity of Doctrin in one age, and to decline from it in another.</hi> Anſwer. All this is worſe than à <hi>Paralogiſm</hi> or any captious way of reaſoning, for it tend's to non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe vnless the main Suppoſition be proued, <hi>to wit,</hi> That the Roman Apoſtolical Catholick Church, once certainly pure in Doctrin has or Can decline from her Purity in afrer ages. Mr Stilling: knowes well that Catholicks, who hold their Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, make the receding from its <hi>Purity</hi> à thing impoſſible. How ſenſles then is it in <hi>this place,</hi> where that Queſtion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is <hi>not handled,</hi> firſt to ſuppoſe our Church fallen off from
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102688:101"/> its old Doctrin, and then to tell vs the Fathers <hi>Encomiums</hi> haue<note place="margin">Still that's Suppoſed which should be Proued.</note> nothing to do with it in this preſent ſtate? I argue thus, and Mr Stilling: P. 314. ſeem's to approue it. Vpon the Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Roman Catholick Church has not ſwerued nor can ſwerue from it's firſt pure Doctrin, The Fathers <hi>Elogiums</hi> are in this age as due to it, as in any other. But the Suppoſition muſt ſtand firmly built, as you shall ſee hereafter, vpon ſure grounds and Principles. But contrariwiſe this way of arguing is Non-ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe? I'le ſuppoſe vpon no grounds, the Roman Catholick Church to haue erred, and then I'le do an open iniuſtice and deny it the due Commendations giuen by the Fathers. It is iuſt as if one should ſay. I'le ſuppoſe à man hitherto reputed honeſt, to be à thief and then I'le deny him iuſtice, and hang him vp.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>I ſay vpon no Grounds.</hi> And to proue my Aſſertion, ask? With what Church then viſible in the world were Chriſtians obliged to Communicate, when all ſee S. <hi>Hierome</hi> will haue them to Communicate with ſome Church? Mr Stilling: Anſwers with the Catholick Church. Very Good. I Ask again, whether the Roman Church, and all other Churches vnited in Faith with it, were rightly called the true <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> Grant this you yeild the cauſe, And Confess that Chriſtians were then obliged to be in vnion with the <hi>Roman Catholick Church.</hi> Contrariwiſe, if you deny that to haue been <hi>then the true Church,</hi> you are caſt vpon<note place="margin">No other Church Catholick but the Roman.</note> endless difficulties, and here is one which cannot be ſolued. Vpon the denial you, Sr, are obliged to <hi>denote,</hi> or name an other Catholick Church diſtinct from the Roman, more pure in Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin at that time, than She was, And that not only the Romans, but all others were Aliens and Prophane <hi>who eate not the lambe</hi> or communicated not in faith, with your new <hi>found fancied Church</hi> in the aire. I ſay fancied, for to point at ſuch à Church on earth is as impoſſible, as to proue known condemned Hereticks to be good Catholicks, whereof ſee more in the other Treatiſe. Diſc. 3. c. 1.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Mr Stilling. to shift off the difficuIty will perhaps ſay, When S. Hierome wrote This, The Roman Church was truly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102688:101"/> Orthodox, and that He accounted all <hi>Aliens</hi> and <hi>Prophane</hi> who communicated not with it. Moſt true Doctrin: But ſee what followes. Be pleaſed to fall lower to the third or fourth Age after S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> There was then, I hope, à Catholick Church in the world, wherwith Chriſtians Communicated in Faith; but moſt euidently there was not any <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en</hi> reputed Orthodox, if we exclude the Roman from being ſo, For all other Societies <hi>name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In the ages after S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, no Church Orthodox but the Roman.</note> though called Chriſtians were profeſſed Hereticks; With theſe no man was obliged to communicate, Therefore all were either bound to Communicate with the Roman Catholick Church, or with no Church at all. Hence I infer that the Fathers <hi>Elogium's</hi> giuen to the Roman Catholick Church were euer moſt iuſtly due, not once only, during the Primitiue times, but now alſo and in all Ages: Withall I aſſert, That Mr Stilling: denying this Truth, ſpeak's his own fancy without proof, or the leaſt appearance of any probable Principle. And he will be as wholly vnprincipled, if I firſt ſuppoſe (as I may if my Creed be true) That there is now at this very houre à true Catholick Church on earth, and should next demand, where that Church is, in whoſe vnion I muſt liue and dye? Will He pitch, think ye, vpon an vnion with the <hi>Arians, Graecians, Abyſsins Anabaptiſts Proteſtants</hi> or <hi>Quakers?</hi> Light where he pleaſeth, he can only vent his fancy without Proof or Principle. Now caſt as it were this fancy into à ballance with thoſe moſt weighty ſignificant Teſtimonies of ancient Fathers, who poſitiuely preſs for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Roman Catholick Church, and you will ſee à ſtrange vneauen <hi>Parallel</hi> (conceited whimſyes, And ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Arguments, laid together). Yet wonder nothing, for weak fancy is the ſtrongeſt Aduerſary Catholick Religion hath<note place="margin">S. Cyprians Teſtimony propoſed.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. You haue yet an other Authority groſly miſvſed by Mr Stilling: Page 315. And t'is à known Paſſage of <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> in his 55. <hi>Epiſtle to Cornelius,</hi> where he complain's of certain factious Schiſmaticks, <hi>who dared to ſail to the chair of S. Peter, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Church from whence Prieſtly vnity had its Origen, and carry letters
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102688:102"/> from Prophane and Schismatical perſons. Nec cogitare eos eſſe Remons</hi> &amp;c. not thinking them to be the Romans (<hi>whoſe Faith</hi> the Apoſtle commended) <hi>ad quos perfidiae haebere non poſsit acceſſum,</hi> to whom fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, vntruth, vnfaithfulnes, cannot haue Access. Thus S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> And I put much force in thoſe words. <hi>Eos eſſe Romanos.</hi> Thoſe who then liued to be the Romans, prophetically commended by the Apoſtle, which words taken in an obuious ſenſe argue, that true Faith should neuer part from the <hi>See of Rome.</hi> But Mr Stilling: conceal's this force, and tranſlates. <hi>Not conſidering that the Romans</hi> &amp;c. No less energy lies in the other following words. <hi>To whom vnfaithfulnes can haue no Acceſs,</hi> which ſeem to exclude à <hi>poſsibility</hi> of falshood from the Roman Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now liſten à little to four ſtrange Gloſſes laid vpon this one Text. Three of them are the Bishops, and one Mr Stilling:<note place="margin">Vain Gloſſes Laid vpon The Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> laies claim to, The Bishops ſaies firſt. <hi>Perfidia</hi> can hardly ſtand here for errour in Faith. And why not my Lord? He An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. It properly ſignifies <hi>malicious falshood</hi> in matter of Trust, or in fact againſt the Diſcipline And gouerment of the Church. And I ſay, it as properly ſignifies <hi>Vnfaithfulnes,</hi> or <hi>Vntruth,</hi> And therefore excludes errour in Faith from the Romans; yea it muſt haue this ſenſe here, becauſe its oppoſed to the Faith of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſo much commended by the Apoſtle, which was true Chriſtian Faith. <hi>Perfidia</hi> therefore fignifies the quite contrary, that is errour in Faith. But grant the ſenſe to be as the Bishop gloſſeth, it excludes at leaſt from the Romans to whom S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> wrote, à Poſſibility of doing any thing againſt the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Gouerment of the Church, or of being maliciouſly falſe in Matter of Truſt. If this be ſo, much more are they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by virtue of theſe words. (<hi>Ad quos perſidia non poſsit habere acceſſum</hi>) from à poſſibility of erring in Faith, for what auail's it to haue à Church garded from vniuſt dealing in Matters of Truſt, if you make it lyable to Errour in the main <hi>Eſſential,</hi> which is true Faith, the very ground of Saluation, And Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cauſe alſo of <hi>iust proceeding</hi> amongst Chriſtians? Perhaps the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe men will ſay. <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> in his <hi>Elogium</hi> reſpected only the <hi>firſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102688:102"/> Romans</hi> commended by the Apoſtle, not Thoſe who liued in his<note place="margin">An other Gloſs refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> time. Contra 1. That is not only ſaid without Proof, but improbably falſifies the Saints express words. <hi>Eos eſſe Romanos,</hi> as is now noted. Contra. 2. If <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> only relate to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> whom the Apoſtle taught, what need is there to keep à coile about the ſignification of <hi>Perfidia,</hi> when thoſe firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had for their Inſtructor an <hi>Infallible Apoſtle.</hi> If therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> could not err in faith, <hi>Perfidia,</hi> may well exclude all misbelief or errour in Matters of Faith from <hi>that Apoſtolical Church.</hi> And here we make way to diſcouer the Bishops leuity in his ſecond Gloss.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Suppoſe ſaith he, it be granted that, <hi>Perfidia,</hi> Signifies errour in faith, or Doctrin, yet it belongs not to the <hi>Romans abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely,</hi> but with <hi>à reſpect</hi> to thoſe firſt Romans, whoſe Faith was commended by the Apoſtle. Contra 1. Vpon what certain Principle doth this confident Aſſertion ſtand? <hi>It belongs not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to the Roman</hi> Church? Proue thus much by à ſure Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and ſomething is ſaid to the purpoſe. But without à ſolid Probation we look on it as à whimſey only, or à thought of fancy. Yet more. What mean's his Lordship by thoſe dark words. <hi>With à reſpect to thoſe firſt Romans?</hi> Will he ſay that the firſt Romans were infallible in Faith and make thoſe others to whom S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> wrote fallible? This muſt be his meaning or nothing,<note place="margin">A ſecond and third Gloſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.</note> For if both were equally <hi>infallible,</hi> or both alike <hi>fallible,</hi> he gains nothing by the word, <hi>Reſpect,</hi> to the firſt Romans. Therefore he muſt hold that ancient Church of Rome to be more infallibly founded in Faith, than the later Romans were to whom <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> wrote; Admit this, He makes the Saint not only to flatter à whole Church, but to ſpeak Nonſenſe alſo. For in effect he ſaith thus much. Your Anceſtors the Romans, were ſo ſecured from errour in Faith, that they could not decline from Chriſt's Doctrin, but you now are in à very tottering Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for you may ſwerue from the Faith of your Anceſtors, you may perhaps belieue as they did, and perhaps not, Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I will <hi>ſooth</hi> you vp and praiſe you, as à Church impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102688:103"/> to erre with, an <hi>Ad quos Perfidia habere non poſsit acceſſum.</hi> You are men ſo faithfull that no Misbelief can touch you. The laſt Gloſs of the Bishop is thus. <hi>S. Cyprians Elogium</hi> ſeem's ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther à <hi>Rhetorical inſinuation,</hi> than à Dogmatical Aſſertion. Mark the proofles word, <hi>Seem's,</hi> t'is only à thought of my Lords fancy, which I am ſure ſeem's far from à dogmatical Aſſertion. What? That à Saint and worthy Bishop should <hi>Rhetorick it</hi> in ſo weighty à Matter? But enough of this nothing.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To make ſomething doe at laſt, Mr Stilling: Page. 317. laies his Gloſs by my Lord's, and has à good opinion of it. To<note place="margin">Mr Stilling: miſinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> giue every man his due, it is better than any of the Bishops. He ſayes in à word, (after à relation of the preſent ſtate of Rome at that time, when thoſe Schismaticks, <hi>Feliciſsimus</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> came thither) that, <hi>Perfidia,</hi> may well <hi>denote</hi> the Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and treacherous dealing of thoſe two Perſons, who ſeemed good Catholicks, but were not ſo, and ſought to ioyn in Communion with <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the Catholick Party, but meant it not. Now ſuch Iuglers should haue no Acceſs to the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Church,</hi> or to thoſe Romans, whoſe Faith the Apoſtle ſo highly extolled, ſo that <hi>Perfidia</hi> Reſpects not the Romans, nor excludes Errour from that Church, but laies falshood (as was well deſerued) on thoſe <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> This I take to be Mr Stilling: meaning. Contra. 1. The Gloſs, euery one ſees, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſtrained, makes the alluſion between <hi>Fides</hi> and <hi>Perſidia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Both Strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and inconſiſtent with S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians ſenſe.</note> inſignificant. 2. It is inconſiſtent with the Authors whole ſenſe, who ſpeak's (not of perfidious men but) of Falshood and Vntruth, which could not haue Acceſs to that principal Church. For it is euident, that perfidious perſons, as Mr Stilling: tell's the Story, actually had Acceſs, And therefore could certainly haue it, when <hi>Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Feliciſsimus</hi> came to Rome. 3. Make the moſt you can of this Gloſs it reaches no further but to à meer far-fetcht <hi>Gueſs,</hi> and what is gained by That? Can Mr Stilling: eſtablish his Opinion of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches fallibility on no ſurer grounds? Can he hope to driue me by gueſſes and Gloſſes, not only from the Obuious ſenſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102688:103"/> of theſe words, but alſo from the clear Expreſſions of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable other Fathers who ſtand openly for an infallible Church? It is à diſperate Improbability. Yet ſo it is: Theſe ſelfcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Gloſſes and nothing els, Vphold Proteſtancy in euery controuerted Matter. The infinite number of them, and the Stories Mr Stilling: tell's to no purpoſe at all, ſo enlarge his <hi>Rational account,</hi> That if you fling theſe away, you may eaſily put the remainder of that Book, into à ſmal <hi>Decimo ſexto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Be pleaſed to obſerue à little. We ſay, and Chriſt ſaid it before vs, <hi>Hell gates should not preuail againſt the</hi> Church founded<note place="margin">Gloſſes oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Proofs.</note> by Diuine Prouidence, But fancied Gloſſes diſputes it at laſt into à <hi>Poſsibility</hi> of being peruerted by Hell, and Hereſy alſo. We ſay, it is <hi>the Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> but Gloſſes laid vpon theſe words muſt be thought ſo ſtrong as to shake it all in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. We ſay, <hi>Chriſt will be with his Spouſe</hi> to the end of the world.

But à companie of Gloſſes ſpoil all this Doctrin, And ſo rack the ſenſe of theſe clear Expreſſions, that one may boldly ſwear, the Gloſs and Text are ſworn enemies.</p>

C. 4. n. 8. of our Proteſtants Gloſſes, Here you haue à fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcouery of their weakness, And t'is the only thing aym'd at in this, And the precedent Chapters. In à word thus I conclude. That man who in Matters of Controuerſies defend's à Doctrin vpon no ſurer grounds then meer doubtful And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Gloſſes are, added to Scripture and the Fathers, (which<note place="margin">An aſſertion clearly laid forth.</note> ſeem contrary to his Doctrin) moſt euidently ſtand's vnprinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl'd, proceed's weakly, and proues nothing.

You shall ſee this euidenced in the preſent Matter now briefly hinted at, of the Infallibility of <hi>the Roman Catholick Church.</hi> Mr Stilling: Aſſerts, <hi>She is fallible.</hi> I ask how He proues the Aſſertion?

But he proceed's ſtrangely, and I muſt needs tell you How. The man hopes to weaken our proofs drawn from the Fathers in behalfe of the Churches infallibility, And thereby to eſtablish his Poſition. <hi>She is fallible.</hi> I demand, how
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102688:104"/> can our Proofs be weakned?

What is it he will tamper withall, or how can he make null thoſe manifeſt <hi>Texts</hi> which clearly lye open to euery eye eaſt on the Fathers, And euince, (as we shall ſee hereafter) that the Church is infallible? Mr Stillinfleets ſtrain through his whole book (For, <hi>Facta loquuntur,</hi>) return's the beſt Anſwer.

The Aſſertion concerning the Churches fallibility is no Self-euidenced Truth nor clear <hi>Ex terminis</hi> (no more is our contrary Doctrin of the Churches infallibility) To giue it Therefore proof and weight, theſe Gloſſes are caſt vpon the Fathers, who ſeemingly at leaſt fauour <hi>infallibility; But theſe very Gloſſes which should do that ſeruice are as vneuident, as vncertain, And doubtful as the very Doctrin is, They should enlighten and lend proof too, Ergo they aduance not at all the Doctrin concerning the Churches fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.</hi> For, proofs which are as vncertain as the very Doctrin is which should be proued, can neuer raiſe that to à greater meaſure of certainty than it had before ſuch proofs were thought of. Pleaſe to mark what I ſay. The Doctrin of the Churches
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102688:105"/> fallibility here ſuppoſed by Sectaries is vncertain, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lies in it's. <hi>Vneuidence,</hi> vntil ſolid Proofs clear it, or expel both the vneuidence and vncertainty, But theſe Gloſſes when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, are as vneuident and vncertain as the Doctrin is, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot raiſe the Doctrin to any higher degree of certainty, than to meer <hi>vneuidence</hi> and <hi>vncertainty: I would haue this noted,</hi> For it is à ground whereby I shal show hereafter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy to be à moſt improbable Religion, And Therefore will deliuer it once more in theſe plainer Terms. If the Sectary has no ſurer Principle whereon to found his yet vneuidenced opinion, of the Churches fallibility then Doubtful Gloſſes laid on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">The force of our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more ſignificantly expreſſed.</note> and Fathers; (as euidently he has not) And Theſe Gloſſes, which should proue that Doctrin be as deuoid of ſtrength as remote from Principles, as vncertain, or doubtful, as that very, yet vneuidenced Doctrin is; It followes clearly, That both the Doctrin and the Gloſſes fall to nothing but only ſubſiſt by fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which is à real Truth. From all now ſaid I inferr, that whoeuer interpret's, muſt haue his Doctrin firmly grounded vpon certain Principles diſtinct from his own interpretations (as the Catholick euer hath) or nothing is proued.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

He may perhaps tell vs our Church has erred de facto, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is fallible: And here is his Principle. I Anſwer its no Principle to me, but an Hereſy; And as Aſſerted by him 'tis as much, yea more, doubtful than all his gloſſes are laid together. He may reply. 3. His Gloſſes may at leaſt be thought probable. I vtterly deny that, And here is my ground. Solely conſidered they euidence not their own probability, But need further proof and probable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to rely on; But ſuch proofs are wanting to found Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity vpon, Therefore theſe gloſſes are <hi>ſuppoſed only,</hi> not <hi>proued proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Had Mr Stilling: plain Scripture, any Orthodox Church, or Fathers clear for <hi>the Doctrin maintained by him,</hi> He might well talk of the ſtrength <hi>Of his Gloſſes,</hi> but to make Gloſſes probable,<note place="margin">The Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Gloſſes not ſo much as Probable.</note> when no probable ground ſupports the Doctrin, for <hi>Whoſe ſake he Gloſſes,</hi> is not only loſt labour, but share's much of Non-ſenſe. Again. Were theſe Gloſſes probable, (which I shall neuer grant) our Anſwers to them are at leaſt as probable; And what gain's either Party to their cauſe by skirmishing in the dark with weak Probabilities only?

Grant thus much, We firſt do iniury to Gods Reuelation. Next we are left in ſuſpence, And know not what to belieue.

If he doth, no weaker Principle then plain Scripture can be my Security, And this I require of him.

Laſtly, may Topicks auail here, we lay an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obligation on our ſelues whilſt all muſt ſay, God will haue vs to belieue and with all certainty what he hath reuealed in this particular; Yet when we come to examin the Grounds and Proofs of our certain belief, All Proofs vanish away into Topicks<note place="margin">Proofs of Chriſtianity no weak To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks.</note> and vncertain fancies.

Here, Sr, its clear you vnderſtand not your ſelfe, For it's no more Idolatry to worship one as à ſaint that's none, then to reuerence one for à Father (or prince) who is not ſo. Idolatry is then committed when we either adore à <hi>creature as God,</hi> or appropriate ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to it which belongs to God.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102688:108"/> of the Heathen and the Catholick? Muſt both of them be ſuppoſed to err ſo groſly, as to own Auguſtus à Saint in Heauen as the Patriarchs and Apoſtles now are Or muſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick only iudge ſo? This later cannot be vnless you make the Catholick moſt inuincibly ignorant. Howeuer, ſuch an errour is poſſible, For as à man by inuincible ignorance may iudge one to be à Prince who is not, in like manner He may be ſo inuincibly beguiled as to think <hi>Augustus</hi> à Saint who is not, And ſo may the Heathen (though t'is very difficult) be deceiued alſo. Vpon this Suppoſition of inuincible ignorance which you, Sr, neuer reflected on, I Anſwer. Neither the Heathen nor the Catholick doe, or<note place="margin">Inuincible ignorance excuſes all Crime.</note> can commit (we muſt Still vſe your improper Phraſe) <hi>Formal Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> but <hi>material only,</hi> The reaſon is euident. For though <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> be really no Saint, yet that middle kind of excellency now mentioned, is vpon the Suppoſition inuincibly apprehended by both as if He were one, And conſequently the apprehenſions had of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Sanctity, the inclinations of their <hi>Wills</hi> to Teſtify their deuotion to him, And external actions may be equal, yea one and the ſame in both, but without fear of any <hi>formal</hi> falſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, becauſe inuincible ignorance takes off that <hi>formal</hi> Crime, And thus far, if we ſpeak of ſinful Veneration, there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them. The inſtance now hinted at clear's all.</p>
               <p n="10">10. One comes among vs from à ſtrange Countrey nobly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, demean's himſelf like à Prince, or ſome great Perſon, and though in real truth he is no more but à Counterfeit, yet He imploies his wit ſo well, diſſembles ſo dexterouſly, That all inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly iudge him to be what he is not, à Perſon of honour: They apprehend à middle kind of excellence in him between à great Monarch and an ordinary man, Reuerence him accordingly by their external actions, and inclinations of their wills, and therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re commit (might one ſpeak ſo) ſome kind of <hi>Ciuil material Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> But are excuſed from the formal offence, becauſe of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, which is both inculpable and inuincible.

What this excellence is as it ſtand's in the Apprehenſions of à Heathen and Catholick? You will hàue it. 2. To be ſome thing which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belongs to the Supreme God nor to à meer mortal man, Therefore what euer you imagin, is no real Obiect in <hi>Caeſar,</hi> nor any Excellence due to him. Whence it followes that all theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, or iudgements rather, (for apprehenſions ſolely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered are neither true nor falſe) which attribute that middle Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> are falſe in themſelues, becauſe not conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Obiect. Now further: If falſe in themſelues, they are either <hi>vincibly</hi> and <hi>culpably</hi> falſe, and Therefore ought to be laid aſide; Or <hi>inuincibly</hi> false, becauſe the iudgement is inuincibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded. Suppoſe the firſt caſe of vincible errour, what euer prayer or Adoration followes vpon that iudgement is both à formal and<note place="margin">How the worship may be ſinful.</note> material Crime, becauſe ſome kind of excellence is vnworthily giuen to <hi>Augustus</hi> which belong's not to him.

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore I verily think you, Sr, vnderſtand not your ſelfe too well, when you firſt ſuppoſe the <hi>Ratio formalis</hi> of prayer or Adoration the ſame in the Catholick and Heathen, And then tell vs, we are not to enquire <hi>whether the Apprehenſion be true or falſe, but what the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that act of Religion is, which is conſequent vpon ſuch an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Sr, in caſe of inuincible ignorance, it little import's to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falshood</hi> of the Apprehenſion, for neither

All then which ought to be ſearched into though omitted by you is. How, or in what manner theſe misled iudgements tend vnto their Obiect? If blameably, becauſe <hi>vincible</hi> they are ſinful, if inuincible and not in mans power to mend, They cannot hurt any. In all other caſes except this one of inuincible ignorance you muſt enquire whether the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion or iudgement be true or false.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Proteſtant after all his Gloſſes can not aſcertain any, of true Religion. He would make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies an endles work.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. YOu haue been ofen told aboue, that Sectaries would fain make controuerſies à long work, I muſt now giue you the vltimate reaſon Thereof, And withal proue it impoſſible to know in theſe mens Principles, what is à Chriſtian Truth, and what not, Their Gloſſes and impropable way of Arguing laies all which can be ſaid in darknes and obſcurity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To proceed clearly. I ſuppoſe firſt, that Chriſtian Truths <hi>as reuealed,</hi> or Contained in Chriſts Doctrin are infallible, and<note place="margin">Principles ſuppoſed.</note> ſtand firm vpon infallible Reuelation. I may here alſo ſuppoſe. 2. That either we Catholicks, or our Proteſtant Aduerſaries, euen in ſuch Tenets as we differ, Belieue and profess <hi>Chriſtian Truths.</hi> For example. <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> or no <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> is à Chriſtian truth. <hi>The Infallibility</hi> of the Roman Catholick Church, or Her <hi>fallibility</hi> is à Chriſtian Truth, for they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories held by Chriſtians, Therefore the one or other muſt be owned true, if maintained as Chriſtian Doctrin. I ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. 3. That neither part of theſe Contradictions; <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> or no <hi>Tranſubstantiation</hi> (in like manner we diſcourſe of all other oppoſite Doctrins) are held their own <hi>Self-euidence</hi> or manifeſtly true <hi>Ex terminis</hi> like the firſt Principles in nature, If Therefore aſſented to as Chriſtian Truths by the one contrary Party, or the other; They muſt be proued by ſure Principles extrinſecal to the Doctrin which each Party embraceth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now you shall ſee What work Sectaries make in theſe Diſputable Matters, And how nothing can be certainly known
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102688:110"/> by Them, or owned as à Chriſtian verity. I would ſay, It<note place="margin">An Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Proued.</note> Can neither be proued in their Principles, That to deny <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> (let this one inſtance ſerue for all) is à Truth, or, that to hold <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> is an Errour. Here is my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. When Principles whereon ſolid proofs should ſubſiſt are not, Proofs muſt of neceſſity fail, But in thoſe Controuerted Matters Sectaries haue no Principles at all to Argue by, Therefore proofs muſt fail. The Minor is euidenced thus. All imaginable Principles whereon Proofs can ſtand in this conteſt, muſt either be infallible, or at leaſt morally certain (Meer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability want's ſtrength to vphold à Chriſtian Truth) But the Sectary cannot proue by any either <hi>infallible</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that his Tenet is à Chriſtian Truth, And ours Contrary to him is an Errour, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The firſt part of my Aſſertion ſeem's euident. For you know what hauock the Sectary makes of all infallible Principles, Scripture only excepted, (which I am ſure ſpeak's not à word in his behalf, nor againſt vs). All <hi>Churches</hi> with him, <hi>All Tradition,</hi> All <hi>Councils,</hi> All <hi>Fathers</hi> alſo are fallible and may deceiue. Therefore thus much is indiſputably clear, He cannot proue <hi>infallibly</hi> (I ſay no more yet) that his Tenets are Chriſtian Truths; or infallibly, That <hi>ours</hi> contrary, are Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, For no man can more deriue an infallible proof from à meer fallible Principle, than fetch gold out of dross or light out of Darknes. Whateuer Therefore he plead's by next, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the degree of infallible certainty. And what is it think ye? O, He has Moral Aſſurance (and here is the Principle) that his Tenets are Chriſtian Truths, and Ours false or erroneous. Very<note place="margin">Fallible Principles ground not infallible Doctrin.</note> good. I ask (Though moral certainty auail's nothings, as we Shall ſee hereafter) How he proues no <hi>Tranſubstantiation</hi> to be à Doctrin morally certain, When the Contrary is expreſly defined in three General Councils, And held by à learned Church? Has he any Council ſo renowned, as either the <hi>Latheran</hi> or <hi>Tridentine,</hi> which euer owned his <hi>Negatiue,</hi> as à Chriſtian Truth? Has he any Church as Vniuerſally ſpread the whole whorld ouer as the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is, which maintained his Doctrin three or four Ages ſince?
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102688:111"/> Euidently No. Vpon what then, ground's He his Moral certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inty? I'le tell you in à word. All he can pretend to, or plead in This Controuerſy comes to no more, if it reach ſo far, But to two or three dubious Authorities, taken from thoſe Fathers who <hi>were Profeſſed members of the Roman Catholick Church;</hi> And this little ſlender part He makes not only to ſtriue againſt the whole Church, but moreouer giues it ſo much ſtrength as to Impeach That great Moral body of errour, And vtterly to ruin the Doctrin which hath been taught age after age; That is to<note place="margin">A part Compared with the whole.</note> ſay. The leſſer Part, (or rather à meer ſuppoſed part) muſt be thought ſo powerful as to make à happy war Offenſiue and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue againſt that whole Moral body whereof it was à member. Is not this à ſtrange Simplicity?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be pleaſed to take here one Inſtance from Ciuil affaires only. Suppoſe you haue à Parlament conſiſting of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and three iuſt, vpright, graue and moſt intelligent Perſons, who firſt treat of ſome weighty Matter relating to the good of à Kingdom or Common wealth, And after long deliberation Enact what in prudence is thought beſt in order to its Setle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

And this is done, (reflect<note place="margin">An Inſtance</note> ſeriously) vpon no other ground, for no other reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Three are wilfully ſuppoſed, by à third Party looking o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:102688:111"/>5. Our very caſe is here ſufficiently expreſſed, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances<note place="margin">Applyed to our preſent purpoſe</note> eaſily applyed to our preſent purpoſe. The Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church is, you know, à great Moral body comprehending not hundreds, but thouſands and thouſands, whereof innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are now and in paſt Ages haue been moſt iuſt, vpright, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and without Controuerſy moſt eminently-learned. Theſe vnanimouſly Enact as it were (whether in the <hi>Repreſentatiue</hi> of Councils, or by the vniuerſal voice and vote of the whole Church,) That <hi>Praying to Saints, prayers for the Dead,</hi> or which we now inſiſt on, the Doctrin of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> are not only Tenets <hi>morally</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Authorities not clear imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> 
                  <hi>certain,</hi> But more ouer Articles of Diuine Faith. Our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to oppoſe this vnqueſtionable certainty, produce three or four Authorities not clear (as is ſuppoſed done in Parlament) but weak and ſtrained, and hope hereby to reuerſe, to vnuote, what theſe thouſands haue decreed contrary. Three or four witneſſes, And theſe at moſt dubious, are here brought in againſt <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> to make our new mens opinion Morally certain, and yet Theſe thouſands, moſt wiſe and learned, though they clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vote and profess againſt it, cannot, forsooth, gain ſo much credit with à few Sectaries as to aduance the Doctrin to moral Certainty, For here we waue the queſtion of infallible Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. What Doings are theſe? <hi>What daies do we liue in?</hi> The whole Catholick Church teaches as She euer taught, that the very Subſtance of bread is really changed into Chriſts Sacred body, And now (o ſtrange times) one Theoderet though no way oppoſit is haled in, to reuerſe the Doctrin. One, muſt ſtriue againſt, and conquer Thouſands. It is, we ſay, à pretty feat to kill two Birds with one bolt, But here we haue à greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, <hi>Theodoret</hi> is ſuppoſed to leuel ſo right with à darker ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions (if yet dark) That he deſtroies the Faith of two Churches at Once, the Greeck and Latin.

What's one againſt innumerable? Tradition both Ancient and modern deliuers the Truth we Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102688:112"/> And an vnknown Gelaſius, ſet vp by Sectaries, muſt be thought powerful enough to repeal and contradict our fore Fathers Tradition. What Doings are theſe? Can the Sectary hope to beate down that ſtronge <hi>Fortress</hi> which Hell gates could neuer yet shake by ſuch ſlight and forceless Armour? Alas, goe to ſingle vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, we oppoſe our <hi>Iustins,</hi> our <hi>Cyrills,</hi> our <hi>Cyprians</hi> our <hi>Chriſoſtoms,</hi> clear and expreſs againſt one <hi>Theoderet</hi> were he doubtful.

His pretended Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral certainty ſtand's not firm like an vncontradicted Truth, againſt ſuch à Cloud of oppoſit witneſſes. And.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Here you haue à further reaſon of my Aſſertion. As long as this Principle ſtand's ſure in nature. <hi>A whole body is greater than à Part, and à Part thereof leſſe extended than the whole,</hi> So long it will be indiſputably euident, That the vote or voice of à whole moral body (I mean of à Vniuerſal Church far and neer extended)<note place="margin">A further proof of our Aſſertion.</note> carries with it greater Moral certainty (For all this while we touch not vpon Infallibility) than à ſmall and ſlender Part can haue, were ſuch à part found ſo inuincibly ignorant as to contradict the whole. All I would ſay is. No more can à few particular members (Though Angels for knowledge) conteſt with the contrary iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of our ample Church, Than three votes in Parlament, with the Contrary iudgement of à whole Kingdom. No more can the Authority of particular men equalize, much less ſurmount in weight and worth, the Sentiment of à whole Moral body, than à hand, For example, ſurpass in bigness the whole man. As the one exceed's in quantity and <hi>Extenſion,</hi> ſo the other doth in weight and <hi>Intenfion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Hence you ſee firſt. How poorly Sectaries play at ſmall Game, when hauing no ancient Church of their own to recurr to, They are fain to run for refuge to à <hi>Few Fathers profeſſed members of our Church,</hi> And here like people picking Salads, gather vp ſome ſmall fragments which now they clip, now mangle, now peruert,

With theſe they flourish and vapour as if, forſooth, à ſmall parcel were able to contraſt with the far greater Moral body, or à few ſtolen gleaning (were all true they ſay) ſufficient to Vnuote what euer this Oracle of Truth hath defined contrary. Leaue of, I beſecch you Gentlemen this Trifling, giue vs weight for weight, meaſure for meaſure, Pleaſe to plead by ſound Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or you loſe the cauſe, Doge not with vs, we deal nobly with you.</p>

It is not one nor ten Theoderets, though they ſpeak far more clearly than is done, That can preiudice our Doctrin, whilſt you haue neither <hi>Church</hi> nor <hi>Councils</hi> for yours. Theſe Principles we demand of you, but you haue them not. Therefore you are caſt into an impoſſibility of writing Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies hereafter, For the few Shreds of Fathers vnluckily cut out by you are too ſlight, to obſcure the greater <hi>Lights</hi> of our Chriſtianity, of our <hi>Church,</hi> of our <hi>Councils,</hi> of our <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>innumerable Fathers.</hi> Belieue it, had the Fathers you Quote ſo much Strength, as you imagin, others would haue read them before your eyes were open, better Iudgements would haue weighed what force they had, before your <hi>Luthers</hi> and <hi>Caluins</hi> we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

               <p n="9">9. You ſee. 2. in what à pitifull caſe Sectaries are, when no more is alleged againſt our Catholick Doctrin (And reſt aſſured They haue no more) but à few ſcattered Authorities now taken<note place="margin">Doubtful. Authorities, of no weight at all.</note> from one, now from another ancient Father.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thus. The Authority is either expreſly plain againſt vs (which I neuer yet ſaw in any Doctrinal Conteſt between the Catholick and Proteſtant) or Contrariwiſe, <hi>doubtful,</hi> and <hi>ambiguous.</hi> If doubtful; it decides nothing, nor can the Proteſtant though He Vow's it Clear, make it ſoe, whilſt the learned Catholick auouches the Contrary; Hitherto both of them ſtand vpon Opinions and end nothing. Neither can the one or other yet abſolutly Say by virtue of ſuch à Paſſage only. <hi>Your Doctrin is False, And mine is True,</hi> For à Principle rationally apprehended dubious, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min's none to an abſolute true iudgement, one way or other. Let vs therefore ſuppoſe contrary to Truth, That the Sectary produceth à Father indubitably clear againſt Catholick Doctrin. Thanks be to God Theſe great lights of the Church are not ſo ſcarce with vs, But that we are able to confront that one Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the plain Teſtimonies of other Fathers far more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. And thus much I here engage to do, may it pleaſe Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to come to à iuſt Tryal, and fully examin with me this one point of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> now hinted at: And if after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt we do not only match our Aduerſary, but quite outvie him with many more Teſtimonies fully as clear and clearer, We may then rationally ask what's one clear Authority worth? I ſay yet more. Though we falſly ſuppoſe theſe particular contrary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities to lie <hi>euen, or equal on both Sides,</hi> I mean, as pregnant for the Sectary, as for the Catholick, yet I neither loſe my cauſe,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102688:113"/> nor he gain's his, Becauſe neither of vs can abſolutly ſay vpon<note place="margin">what if authorities were equal on both ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des?</note> Moral certainty, which Doctrin is à Chriſtian Truth, And which not. For in this conflict of Authorities <hi>Suppoſed equal,</hi> both iudgements are left in ſuſpence, The one ſaith I quote clear Authorities for my <hi>Tenet:</hi> The other anſwers Hee doth ſo too, And Therefore hitherto ſtand ſo equally poiſed That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may cry Victory: Neither can yet pretend to ſo much Moral certainty as excludes All reaſonable doubting, becauſe both Parties muſt doubt, whilſt the Authorities of the one abate the force of the other. What then followes from the Fathers Teſtimonies were they thus equally diuided; That is, if as many clearly ſtood for the Negatiue of no <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> And iuſt as many clearly for the Contrary Poſitiue? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, This followes. That we and Sectaries muſt of neceſſity, (<hi>will we know Truth</hi>) either appeal to à third certain concluding Principle, or ſtand doubtfully opining (as is often done in<note place="margin">what follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes vpon arguing out of doubtful Principles.</note> ſchools) without à final <hi>Deciſion.</hi> For, to Belieue any thing certainly as Catholicks belieue, if <hi>that Principle be excluded,</hi> or, to know any thing yet morally certain, as Sectaries pretend to know, is vtterly impoſſible, Becauſe à Principle purely probable, is euidently too weak, either to Support any firm Belief, or to ground ſo much Moral certainty of à Chriſtian Truth, as excludes à poſſibility of doubting.</p>
               <p n="10">10. You will Ask what then is there which may raiſe theſe two Aduerſaries from that low degree of meer <hi>Opining</hi> to à higher degree of certainty? I shall fully Anſwer the Queſtion in the next Diſcourſe, Here I ſay in à word. No Principle can do this, But one only which the Sectary want's, And the Catholick has to rely on, which is the <hi>Tradition,</hi> the <hi>Voice</hi> and open declared <hi>Iudgement</hi> of Chriſts Catholick Church here on earth. This faithful Oracle raiſes vs from the ſuppoſed State of our gueſſing Probably, to the higheſt degree of not only <hi>Moral,</hi> but alſo of Infallible certainty, Though now we preſs not that againſt our Aduerſaries. The Sectary Therefore who diſdain's to learn of this Oracle what Chriſtian Truths are, shall
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102688:114"/> neuer come to his Moral certainty, though the Suppoſition alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made of Authorities equal ſtood in vigour. Iudge then, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, How deſperate his Cauſe is now, How remote from all ſuch certainty <hi>De facto,</hi> (whether he impugn's our Doctrin, or plead's for his own opinions) when he hath nothing to rely on, but only à few dark and dubious Paſſages of ſome ancient Fathers?</p>
               <p n="11">11. I ſay <hi>dubious Paſſages,</hi> for in Truth (if ſo much) they are no more, And Therefore though we haue hitherto ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Authorities <hi>euenly</hi> laid on both ſides (To Show that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">What the Sectary can Plead.</note> help's the Sectary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of his labyrinth) yet now I muſt tell the Story as t'is. All he has in this world to plead, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes only to à few miſinterpreted Authorities, And with ſuch poor Gleanings, <hi>Churchless man as He is,</hi> he thinks to Out-braue à whole Church, To decry Tradition, to vnſenſe the Fathers, to rob vs of our right, And finally to throw vs out of the <hi>Poſſes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of thoſe ancient Chriſtian Truths, which both we and our Anceſtors haue profeſſed age after age without Alteration. What think ye? Haue à few rack't and tortured Sentences (Add to them as many <hi>Cauils,</hi> as many <hi>Criticiſms</hi> as you pleaſe) force enough to do ſuch wonders? Can theſe gleanings, miſinterpreted as you haue ſeen, better inform vs of the ancient Primitiue Truths, than the General voice or vniuerſal conſent of à whole Church now in being? It is improbable. Grant therefore (which I do<note place="margin">On what Principle the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Stand's</note> not) That we know not too well the ſenſe of one <hi>Theoderet,</hi> or of à <hi>Tertullian</hi> &amp;c. The Catholick cleares his Doctrin, And drawes it from ſurer Principles. viz. From the voice and open declared Iudgement of his Church, And moſt deſeruedly look's on the Sectaries attempt as highly improbable, who will needs know what Doctrin we are to hold now, or, was anciently held amongſt Chriſtians, by à Fathers Teſtimony, when the very ſenſe is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed doubtful, And lies in obſcurity.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102688:114"/> though Conſcious, that à whole ample Church decries their Doctrin as false And the open abuſe of Fathers alſo. O, ſaith the Sectary, I little regard what the Church decries. Anſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What in God's name would you be at? What can you pretend<note place="margin">The Church oppoſed to Sectaries Clamours.</note> or intend? Shall clamours, Think ye, and your few clouded Teſtimonies force me to leaue my ancient Faith, when I euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, That the Church I liue in, call's louder on me and more rationally command's me to Belieue as I doe? This audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble known voice of Chriſt's Church dull's your clamours, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly Outweigh's your Gloſſes, your gueſſes, And the doubtful Sentiment of any priuate Father.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Sectary may reply. I haue now ſuppoſed, without Proof, the Fathers abuſed by him, whereas, if the Suppoſition hold's, its only doubtful whether it be ſo or no. Anſw: Thus much is only ſuppoſed doubtful, That neither of vs can learn by words preciſely obſcure, what Doctrin to embrace, or what to reiect, Before à ſurer Oracle ſpeak's and decide, the Controuerſy. Catholicks ſay this Oracle is the Church, The Proteſtant who has no Church to recurr to, ſtand's trifling with his obſcure Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, hoping at laſt to make ſomething of nothing, to hammer out of dark ſentences the Clear Moral certainty of his new Doctrin Though contrary to the whole Church, And thus He abuſeth both Fathers and reaſon alſo, Becauſe as I ſaid iuſt now, <hi>A doubtful Principle yeilds</hi> not ſo much certainty. If He ſay. 3. His quoted Authorities are ſufficiently clear to ground the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral certainty of his Doctrin againſt the Church, it is à deſperate, improbable Speech, For Moral certainty (which should pass as an vncontradicted truth) moſt euidently loſeth that force, when à whole Church manifeſtly <hi>contradict's</hi> it. But hereof enough is Said in the other Treatiſe. Diſc. 1. C. 6. n. 3.</p>
               <p n="13">13. You will ask perhaps, What is to be done if we meet with à Father ſo clear and expreſs againſt Church-Doctrin that he

I Anſwer.<note place="margin">A doubt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ſolued.</note> Suppoſe thus much, which I think was neuer yet heard of in any Conteſt betwixt the Proteſtant and Catholick, I'le abſolutly deny the Authority and adhere to Church-Doctrin; For, as the whole body is greater than à part, ſo the iudgement of à whole Church is the ſtronger Principle here, and ought in reaſon to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and bear ſway, before the ſentiment of any priuate man, who by weaknes or inaduertancy may ſlip aſide into Errour. I ſay through <hi>weaknes or incogitancy,</hi> for if he obſtinately oppoſe the Church, He is no Father in that, But an Heretick.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Whoeuer reflects well on what is noted already will ſee, I hope, How neer we are to an End of diſputes with Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants if the Conteſt ariſe from the Authority of Fathers. Here is the Ground of what I am to Say. All the Authorities which can<note place="margin">What Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities can be quoted?</note> be quoted in Points now Controuerted are either plain, or eſteemed plain for Catholick Doctrin both by the learned of our Church, and Sectaries alſo, As is amply proued aboue: Or Contrariwiſe, are at moſt ſuppoſed doubtful. I Aſſert it boldly, the Sectary has not one plain Teſtimony for him in this debated Matter of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> And if one or two were granted plain that's nothing to contraſt with à whole Church and innumerable other Fathers.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Hence I Diſcourſe. In caſe Authorities be Clear for Catholick Doctrin, the Sectary oppoſes vs improbably, if he ſeek to eſtablish his Nouelties vpon à Principle which plainly teaches what we teach, And quite ruin's his contrary Opinions. If the Authority be doubtful, I haue ſaid enough already. viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That, that giues no <hi>Moral certainty,</hi> but leaues you where you were before in à ſtate of doubting. Obſerue now. All you get from the Proteſtant when the Fathers plainly teach Catholick Doctrin, is either to deny the Authority, as the Elder, And perhaps wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Proteſtants haue done, or, after Mr Stillingfleets new Mode,<note place="margin">How Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Shift off Authorities.</note> to Gloſſ them. All you get when à paſſage ſeem's dubious, is to ſquiſe more out of it than it has.

               <p n="2">2. Now here you haue what I wish the iudicious Reader ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly To reflect vpon. Suppoſe one should follow Mr Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet through all thoſe windings and Turnings wherewith he encumber's this one short Sentence of <hi>S.

Suppoſe Hee that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes ſuch à Task should in like manner proceed through all The Gentlemans <hi>Rational Account</hi> (as 'Tis Called) And attend to his diſcourſes, reply to euery particular of his endles Gloſſes, laid on Scripture and other Fathers. Suppoſe Thirdly, He should rigidly Examin euery circumſtance related in the Stories of that volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Book (Doe only thus much and you draw the book dry For beſides cauils you haue no more) How many volumes think ye would This way of Anſwering bring forth to the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole <hi>Account</hi> were Anſwered? And when all is done, Much, God knowes, is not done to end Controuerſies with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Thus the conteſt goes on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr Stillingfleet like one affraid to meddle with ſound Principles begins to Gloſſe, His ſuppoſed Aduerſary, becauſe no better ſtuff is giuen to work vpon, goes not yet deeper into difficulties, But turn's to the Scripture and Fathers, Read's and Iudges by His own Reading That much is interpreted amiſs in

Mr Stillingfleet relates his Stories, ſet forth with à number of circumſtances; Our ſuppoſed Aduerſary diſcouer's (As he thinks) many à Flaw, many à Miſtake, much iumbling, much diſorder in the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Circumſtances. Reflect well good Reader. Doe you not ſee here à ſtrange Confuſion? When after the vtmoſt done by theſe two Aduerſaries, You haue two quite different Doctrins raiſed from the ſame Authorities of Scripture and Fathers? And that after the recourſe of both to Hiſtory, You haue two as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Stories told you, as <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>No.</hi> In like manner after Their long diſcourſes, You haue two contradictory Concluſions drawn out, And laid before your eyes to read. Vpon what Principle (if no more be Said) can the yet perplexed Reader come to ſo much certainty of our Chriſtian Truths, as is neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? By what means shall He know, whether of theſe Two, relates the truer Story, Gloſſes, or diſcourſes better? O, He muſt peruſe Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Scripture alſo, And the Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Fathers And then iudge. Pitiful. More than half the world want's means to doe this, And He who is able to comply with that laborious Task, muſt at laſt truſt to his own Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Howeuer, giue me one who will conform Himſelfe to what he Reads, and not draw all to à preiudicated Iudgement, That man will find out Catholick Religion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be it how you will, The Catholick has à better And far more eaſy Principle to rely on in ſo weighty à Matter, whereof<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple far more eaſy and plain.</note> we shall Treat largely in the next Diſcourſe. The Sectary has no other Ground to ſet footing on, But his own priuate Fancy. And here is the true Reaſon why he loues à life to ſtand dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying with you vpon <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>History.</hi> Goe no further, He is ſure to haue ſome Reply at hand, For it is eaſy to trifle à long time, whilſt you only giue him this <hi>Authority</hi> And that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102688:117"/> 
                  <hi>Parcel</hi> of Hiſtory to quarrel with. The one, as we haue ſeen, He wreſt's to what Senſe he pleaſes; On the other He can put ſo fair à Varnish by concealing ſome Circumſtances, and ium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling others together, That the eyes of à vulgar Reader are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily dazled. In the mean time He warily waues (And is well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to doe ſo) The laſt ſound Principles which only can end Controuerſies. Wherefore, Methinks one cannot fit the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Humour better, than to attaque him with Authorities, And next leaue the Gloſſing them to his fancy, To recurr to Antiquity, And permit him to put an other face on the whole Story. Thanks be to God the Catholick Writers of our own Nation (to ſay nothing of others) who handle Matters moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly, And in real truth haue already brought theſe debates to à Period, giue no ſuch Aduantage to Sectaries, But relying<note place="margin">What Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would be at?</note> on ſound Principles, as learnedly reiect theſe Gloſſes, as our new men wilfully make them without Principles. Yet this is Truth. As nouelliſts can do no more But Gloss without Principles, So as I ſaid now, They are well enough content if the Catholick will doe ſomething like them, And only interpret or diſcourſe vpon Authorities; And this I call the <hi>less,</hi> or not the <hi>last</hi> plain way of Ending debates. Goe no further, they think Themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ſafe. For example. Read <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> in the place now cited. <hi>I would not belieue the Goſpel</hi> &amp;c. Ponder His whole Context, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to his learned Diſcourſe, Mark well how He both diſputes and proues: <hi>That he</hi> would not belieue the Goſpel as <hi>Gods Diuine Word</hi> but vpon This ſolid ground, That the <hi>Authority of the Church,</hi> then when he wrote, moued him to belieue ſo. Deſcend yet to other particulars taken from his moſt Connexed way of Arguing, Allege all plainly againſt the Sectary which hath been done and moſt landably again and again by Catholick Authors, Yet after all, you ſee Mr Stillingfleet begins new Quarrels as fiercely, as if nothing had been ſaid, And if one should vnrauel what he hath wouen in his three pages, would not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I mean, you are moſt fierce to end Controuerſies, when you are furtheſt off from Principles, which only can end them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thus <hi>then</hi> you should proceed had not God and Truth ſilenced you. I, E. S. B. D. declare to you honeſt Papiſts, That in the Sixth or ſeauenth age after Chriſt, His true Orthodox Church, poſitiuely taught <hi>no Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Such <hi>à Council,</hi> either in former or later Ages expreſly defined ſo. Then, and before alſo, Church Tradition was vniuerſally for my Doctrin, And thus much I can make good to the learnedeſt Romaniſt among you. Wonder not Therefore when you quote your <hi>Iuſtins,</hi> your <hi>Cyprians,</hi> your <hi>Chriſostoms,</hi> ſeemingly contrary to my Church Doctrin, That I interpret all; I am forced to doe ſo, or againſt conſcience muſt deſert my old <hi>Mother Church,</hi> Her Councils<note place="margin">How Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ought to plead.</note> and Tradition likewiſe, From which You haue too licentiouſly ſwerued, to ſide with your <hi>Iustins</hi> and I know not who els. Could the Sectary plead after this manner, His Gloſſes would haue force, But he neuer meddles with the Firſt main <hi>Buſiness,</hi> That is, neuer ground's his Doctrin vpon any thing like à ſatisfactory Principle, But, as if He minded to tire Ones patience, run's on headlong with Gloſſes, <hi>When he has no Principled Doctrin to Gloss for.</hi> Iuſt as if One should tell his neighbour, Sir you lye, And, this I auerr to your face, Though I want where withall to proue my Saying true. In all theſe Controuerſies Sectaries are ſo pertly vnciuil, as to giue the <hi>Lie</hi> to à whole Church, And what ſupports the Boldnes? Haue they any other Church more Orthodox, Councils more learned, Tradition more vniuerſal to proue we <hi>lye,</hi> than our Church, our Tradition, And Councils are which ſay we ſpeak truth? Nothing at all like them. We here challenge
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102688:119"/> them to ſpeak to the cauſe and controuerſies are ended. What then remain's to plead with? Plain Scripture? <hi>Not à word.</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers plain? <hi>Not one.</hi> O yes, <hi>Tertullian</hi> is drawn in to help at à dead lift, ſo is <hi>Theoderet,</hi> And one or two more. Very true. But he is à gloſſed <hi>Tertullian,</hi> à gloſſed <hi>Theoderet</hi> &amp;c. Separate then theſe Gloſſes from the Fathers genuin Doctrin, giue them the Sectary to manage, you ſee him in open field compleatly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ready to encounter <hi>Church, Councils, Tradition,</hi> And all the other <hi>Principles</hi> of the Catholick world. Are not Gloſſes think<note place="margin">Gloſſes ſtrangely powerful with Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> ye ſtrong and prodigiouſly powerful, which haue not only force to plead againſt à whole Church, But more ouer to implead her of palpable errour? This Church is ſuppoſed to haue changed Her ancient Doctrin, And Sectaries will reform it not by recurring to any other more Orthodox Society of Chriſtians, But by meer gueſſes and Gloſſes. That is. <hi>The Fallible Gloſſes and gueſes of men confeſſedly fallible, must reform à Church which hold's Her ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> And proues it alſo.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thus it is, Chriſtian Reader. I ſpeak plainly, And can defend my Aſſertion. Beſides meer begging the Queſtion in all Diſputes, beſides Cauils, And weak coniectures, The Sectary hath no more left him to oppoſe our Catholick Tenets, but meer vnprincipled Gloſſes. I neither word it nor wrong Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in ſaying thus much. Peruſe if you pleaſe their writings, chiefly Mr Stillingfleets <hi>Account,</hi> you will find (when the Churches <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> &amp;c. Happen to be handled, That Gloſſes laid on the Authorities vſually quoted for Catholick Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, euer take vp the moſt room. And which is worſe, yea pitiful in à <hi>Rational Defender</hi> of Proteſtancy: <hi>You shall neuer find</hi> through this whole Book (waue Cauils coniectures and Gloſſes) one ſound Principle laid plainly forth, nor ſo much as hinted at, in behalf of any Proteſtant Article. What think ye? Shall<note place="margin">Yet Moſt weak and feeble.</note> Chriſtians, who would fain haue à Church to liue in, ſee the old Houſe of God pulled down by vnhandy Gloſſers, before They haue à better built vp, And well ſetled on good Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? <hi>Pulled down.</hi> What ſay I? Alas our Gloſſers haue not
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102688:120"/> ſtrengh to vntile it, much less force to demolish that long ſlanding Fortress. Yet Gloſſes chiefly, And t'is à ſad thought for the Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, ſupport his vndefenſible Schiſm made in the deſperate quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt that Church which gaue his Anceſtors Baptiſm.

Sad thoughts, I ſay, they are to goe to bed with, to riſe with, to banquet with, which like Ghoſts will haunt him to his dying day, And lay Torment at his reſtles hart in his greateſt iollities, And more in the houre of death.</p>

If at that time there was no Authority nor reaſon for the Nouelty, Process of time hath gained it neither. Look then into its <hi>Riſe</hi> or Firſt beginning, you'l find it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound at the bottom, yea vtterly improbable vpon this certain Principle, That the Singular Doctrin of one disguſted Rebel aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt à whole Church and Thouſands more pious and learned then Himſelfe, can merit no Belief, but deſerues (what it has), to be Anathematized.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:102688:120"/>12. We muſt yet inſiſt à little vpon this Point, And lay forth the Vanity of our Aduerſaries pretence to Probability, which done, you shall ſee controuerſies are ended. Sectaries May ſay.<note place="margin">Proteſtancy improbable.</note> If their own Authority makes not Proteſtancy Morally certain, it cannot but raiſe it to à high degree of Probability. We deny this, And shall preſently Ask, why their Authority more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth this Religion to Probability than the meer Authority of Arians bring's Arianiſm to Probability? At preſent we do not only oppoſe the voice and vote of the Roman Catholick Church againſt this Plea, But the Authority alſo of <hi>Graecians, Abyſsins</hi> and all other called <hi>Christians,</hi> who with one vnanimous Conſent decry Proteſtancy as improbable. Compare therefore <hi>votes</hi> with <hi>votes, Authority</hi> with <hi>Authority,</hi> There is no Parallel; For, for one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend's it, you haue hundreds, yea Thouſands that Contradict the Nouelty. Thus much is indiſputably Euident, if we preciſely Conſider Authority as it were in <hi>Abſtracto,</hi> or oppoſe the Votes of diſſenting Parties againſt it. But here is not all. We muſt goe further, And diſtinguish well between <hi>à bare Authority,</hi> and <hi>a rational grounded Authority.</hi> For this is an vndeniable Truth. <hi>Reaſonable Principles</hi> euer precede, or are preſuppoſed, when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is pleaded for To <hi>the conſequent Authority of thoſe</hi> (whether many or few) that Teach, or Profess it. Hence all ſay. If the firſt conuerted Iewes to Chriſtianity, Had not had moſt weighty Inducements propoſed to reaſon before they deſerted Iudaiſm and belieued in Chriſt The change had been moſt imprudent; Nay, all had been obliged, as is proued in the 4. Chapter, To hold on in that Profeſſion ſtill without Alteration. So neceſſary it is to haue rational grounds laid firm in the Foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, before the Profeſſors allow it either Moral certainty, or ſo much as Probability. Thus much premiſed.</p>
               <p n="13">13.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102688:121"/> of the Roman Catholick Church, permitted that faithful Oracle to become Traiterous, to teach Idolatry, to tell the world loud Lies for à thouſand yeares together. And that all this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, when there was no other Orthodox Church on earth to vnbeguile Thoſe poor deluded Chriſtians. The ſecond Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be proued, is.

               <p n="14">14. When theſe two Propoſitions are made probable vpon good Principles, Wee shall liſten to our Sectaries Authority, But if they fumble herein, Only talk and proue nothing, Wee reiect their vngrounded Authority And ſay, The more votes they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply without Proofs, the less weight they haue. You shall yet ſee how weightles Their Authority is, might we here inſiſt longer vpon one Matter of fact which ends all Controuerſies. In à word.

Whether they or we teach<note place="margin">The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty propoſed between Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks and Proteſtants.</note> Apoſtolical Doctrin? Whether they or we lay forth the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſenſe of holy Scripture? Neither Party ſaw or heard the Apoſtles Preach. Neither pretend's now to <hi>Enthuſiaſms,</hi> or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Reuelations concerning that Doctrin: The whole cauſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore is to be tried, and decided by Witneſſes of foregoing Ages, ſuch Teſtimonies and Tradition muſt clear this Matter of fact. A pretence to Scripture only without precedent lawful Paſtors, without Doctors, without Witneſſes teaching that ſenſe and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102688:121"/> Doctrin which the one, or other Party ſtand's for, is here both vſeles and impertinent. If then The Proteſtant makes his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin Apoſtolical, His ſenſe of Scripture, Orthodox; The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick replies. Be pleaſed to giue in your laſt Euidence, produce your Witneſſes; your Paſtors, And Doctors Four Ages ſince, That taught as you teach, And ſenſed Scripture as you ſenſe it. My Church (add's the Catholick) euidently demonſtrates à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſucceſſion of Her Paſtors that taught as I belieue, (as shall be proued hereafter) And shewes as clearly à Succeſion of the ſame Doctrin and Faith with theſe Paſtors. Her Antiquity is vndoubted, and her pleading <hi>Poſſeſsion</hi> in preſeruing the true Senſe of Scripture and Apoſtolical Doctrin, is as great as any King on earth can shew for the Poſſeſſion of the Crown he weares. Now, ſaith the Catholick, Wee examin your pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Paſtors and Doctors, And after ſome few Aſcents by à<note place="margin">The firſt plead by Principles the others not.</note> Retrogradation come at laſt to the year 1517.

With theſe late Runagates you muſt ſtop, No man on earth can aduance or bring your <hi>Genealogy</hi> further, Therefore to ſpeak in the words of the Ancient <hi>Optatus Meliuitan. Lib. 2.

               <p n="15">15. Hence I argue and it is à demonſtration againſt Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. If neither Church, nor Councils, nor Paſtors, nor Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, nor any Orthodox Chriſtians in forgoing Ages euer owned, or ſo much as heard of Proteſtancy before one vnfortunate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therles Luther broached it; If no Antiquity, ſo much as once mentioned one Profeſſor of that Religion; if no Tradition han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Luther the new Faith he taught (all which is without diſpute manifeſt) Proteſtancy moſt enidently is vpon this very account both an <hi>Vnwitneſſed</hi> and <hi>an Vnprincipled</hi> Religion, And not only improbable, but in the higheſt degree improbable. But
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102688:122"/> no Authority can releaſe an vnprincipled Nouelty from its own intrinſick, miſerable and <hi>

And thus Controuerſies are ended, becauſe an improbable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (And for this reaſon improbable, becauſe vnprincipled) is not defenſible.</p>
               <p n="16">16. To add more to this Diſcourſe I Ask, whether one Arius oppoſing the whole Church repreſented in the Nicene Council,<note place="margin">Protestancy as improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as Arianiſm.</note> defended probable Doctrin or no? You will anſwer <hi>No.</hi> Very good. Yet he quoted Scripture (and might one inſiſt vpon the exteriour letter or ſound of words) more plain and expreſs in the behalf of his Hereſy, than all the Proteſtants on earth can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Fathers</hi> plain and <hi>Expreſss</hi> for their Nouelty of Proteſtaniſm. I would ſay. Neither <hi>Theoderet</hi> nor any other Father, ſpeak's half ſo clearly to the Doctrin of <hi>No Tranſubſtantiation. No Sacrifice of the Mass</hi> &amp;c. As theſe words (to omit others). <hi>My Father is greater then I,</hi> (may the exteriour letter regulate here) ſeemingly expreſs an inequality between the Father and the Son. Now if the ſeeming clear ſound of Scripture made not Arius his Doctrin probable againſt the Church <hi>Then,</hi> much less can the more obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Teſtimonies of ſome Fathers, make the Doctrin of Proteſtants probable againſt the Church <hi>Now.</hi> And if we ſpeak of follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers that Arius gained in his time, There is no compariſon, He had more than euer England had Proteſtants in it.</p>
               <p n="17">17. One may yet reply. The Nicene Fathers cited plain Scripture againſt Arius. Very true, And ſo do Catholicks againſt Proteſtants, For, Chriſts Sacred words. <hi>This is my body,</hi> are as ſignificantly plain againſt Proteſtaniſm, as any Text thoſe Fathers then vrged, or yet can be vrged againſt <hi>Arianiſm.</hi>

I Anſwer. 2. Our Proofs (to ſay no more now) Stand firm vpon <hi>Church Authority,</hi> once at leaſt owned Orthodox, on our Councils, and ancient Tradition neuer yet repealed, nor excepted againſt, But by Hereticks only. May it pleaſe our Aduerſaries to come Cloſely to the Point and plead in behalf of their Tenets, by the Authority of any like or better Church than ours is, We haue done, and muſt yeild; But this they know is impoſſible, And therefore neither will nor can Anſwer our Diſcourſe.

               <p n="2">2. They may obiect. 2.

               <p n="3">3. Hence it followes, that all Controuerſies hitherto agitated between vs come to no more, but to à ſlight skirmishing about different opinions only; For we and they agree in the Eſſence of Religion. <hi>Vnlucky opinions</hi> ſurely, Cries the Sectary (and He would ſeem to ſigh as deeply as we, But has not felt ſo much Smart) which haue cauſed endles Broiles, ſtrange confuſion, and à Shameful Schiſm in the Chriſtian world.

Thus I propoſe it.

But the Catholick knowes well becauſe Hereſy can haue no grounded Doctrin, This task is impoſſible. I am now to shew the Proteſtant the impoſſibility of it alſo.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Imagin one who belieues the <hi>Creeds,</hi> as the Sectary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend's to doe, yet ſo, That interiourly And from his very heart He abiures and ſlights all thoſe Negatiue Articles called the opinions of Proteſtants. (I ſpeak not here of his exteriour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour nor Countenance his diſſembling i'ft be ſo) My Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is this. Whether ſuch à man haue internal, eſſential, ſufficient faith to make him à true belieuing Proteſtant? He hold's himſelf one vpon this conuincing Reaſon, That he firmly belieues what euer the Profeſſors of that Religion main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note place="margin">Sectaries muſt make meer Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions their Articles of Faith.</note> as both eſſential and ſufficient to Saluation. Beſides He knowes well, No obligation lies on him to belieue by <hi>Faith,</hi> the Negatiue Articles of Proteſtants, neither can he, becauſe God has not reuealed them. Such à man therefore hath compleatly eſſential Faith enough, and is à true belieuing Proteſtant, or if
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102688:126"/> he be not yet got ſo high, or haue not the Proteſtant Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, neceſſary and ſufficient to ſaue him, He muſt help it out by belieuing ſome one or other Proteſtant Opinion, And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Belief of Opinions muſt either conſtitute him eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially à <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> Or He will neuer be one, yet this is moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, for God obliges none to belieue vnreuealed Opinions as Articles of Faith.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We muſt goe yet further. Suppoſe this man belieues the <hi>Creeds,</hi> The Roman Catholick Church and euery particular Doctrin She teaches, iuſt ſo as the beſt Catholick Belieues, And whereas before He only ſlighted the opinions of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, now in place of them he firmly adheres to the Contrary Catholick Poſitions. viz. To <hi>The Popes Supremacy. Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> An vnbloody Sacrifice. Praying to Saints worhiping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> And in à word to all that the Church obliges me to belieue.<note place="margin">The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty farther vrged.</note> This man in heart is certainly Catholick. I Ask whether he is yet à true belieuing Proteſtant? In our Sectaries Principles, Hee is. For firſt he belieues his Creeds or Doctrin Common to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, And there is the Eſſence of their ſauing Faith. O but all is ſpoiled by <hi>belieuing the Church,</hi> And what euer Doctrin She teaches. Why ſo I beſeech you? why should this ſpoile all, if in Conſcience the man Iudges Her Articles to be reuealed Truths? A Catholick you ſay may be ſaued, Though he belieues thus much, Therefore there is no reaſon to damn this man vpon any Account of his want of Faith, For the Faith of His Creeds ſaues him, And the beliefe of our Catholick Articles ruin's not that Faith. Ergo. Again. You muſt ſay, His abiuring your Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Opinions doth <hi>not Vnproteſtant</hi> Him, if he belieues the Creeds, why then should the firm adhering to our contrary Poſitiue Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Articles (which you call opinions) make him less Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant? You may reply. If He hold's them only as opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, He is ſtill Proteſtant, But we now ſuppoſe He belieues all as Articles of Faith. Very good. This then followes ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitably. <hi>Not to belieue them as Articles of Faith, beſides Owning the Creeds, eſſentially makes him Protestant, Ergo,</hi> This alſo followes
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102688:126"/> To belieue ſome one Negatiue, or more then the Creeds For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally express (Add to them the common Doctrin of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, The four General Councils &amp;c.) is eſſentially neceſſary to Conſtitute him Proteſtant. Now This very <hi>More</hi> which is nothing but à Sectarian Opinion eſſentially enters in to make him Proteſtant, or Hee shall neuer bee one. Thus much I intended to proue, and I hold it proued demonſtratiuely.</p>
               <p n="11">11. You haue what I would ſay, plainly laid forth in this vnanſwerable Dilemma. <hi>He who iudges all the Negatiue Articles of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A dilemma.</note> 
                  <hi>Proteſtants false, And belieues the Contrary Poſitiues taught by our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church As reuealed Truths, is yet Proteſtant, or not. If not; the belief of ſome thing els</hi> (Truth or vntruth) <hi>is eſſentially requiſite to make him Protestant, But the belief of That</hi> (be it what you will) <hi>now ſuperadded to Conſtitute him à Belieuing Proteſtant, is no Truth reuealed by God, But only à Proteſtant Opinion, without which he wants the Eſſence of that Religion, Ergo most euidently the Belief of Opinions eſſentially conſtitutes him à belieuing Proteſtant, Conſequently ſome Doctrin</hi> which God has not reuealed makes him Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, <hi>And the belief of his Creeds is not Faith enough to make him one.</hi> Theſe Inferences ſeem euident, if not, I petition Mr Stillingfleet to diſcouer where the fallacy lies.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now on the other ſide, if ſuch à man as belieues his<note place="margin">Prouing what is intended againſt Sectaries.</note> 
                  <hi>Creeds,</hi> the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> And all the <hi>Articles</hi> She tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches iuſt as I belieue them, be notwithſtanding eſſentially Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant ſtill, <hi>He is both Proteſtant and Catholick together.</hi> Catholick He is, whilſt He Aſſents to all without Reſerue which the Roman Church teaches; And he is alſo Proteſtant, for He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieues his <hi>Creeds,</hi> And what euer our new men require as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to their Religion. Wherefore vnless <hi>The not-belieuing their Negatiues,</hi> or his <hi>ſubmiss yeilding to our Poſitiue Contrary Doctrins,</hi> deſtroy that eſſential Faith <hi>of his Creeds</hi> (which is impoſſible) He is in theſe Principles, both at once Catholique and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And thus you ſee How Our new men end Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, For now in their Principles, There is no more quarrel

               <p n="14">14. Be it how you will, Mr Stillingfleet muſt of neceſſity change his Tittle [<hi>The grounds of Proteſtant Religion</hi>] For now Proteſtancy with him conſiſts with Popery, or <hi>rather</hi> is Popery, And Popery, <hi>If we ſpeak of Religion,</hi> is conſiſtent with Proteſtancy: The Eſſence and grounds of the one and the other cannot but be the ſame, if (which is euer to be noted) Proteſtancy as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy</hi> hath not <hi>one true eſſential Article of Orthodox Faith peculiar to it ſelfe,</hi> For hauing none, The Abettors of it muſt either bee Catholicks, or Profess no Religion.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And here by the way you may note the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween vs. As the Catholick own's all which the Church defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to be <hi>de Fide</hi> And neceſſary to Saluation, So contrariwiſe, the Proteſtant own's nothing within the compass of <hi>His Articles</hi> to be <hi>de Fide,</hi> or in like manner neceſſary, For both He and I may boldly renounce what euer he hold's <hi>as Proteſtant</hi> without danger of loſeing our Souls. And hence it is that Opinions only, and false ones too, eſſentially conſtitute this whole Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. I ſpeak here of Articles <hi>proper to Proteſtancy,</hi> For to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue <hi>the Creeds,</hi> the <hi>four General Councils,</hi> to Aſſert that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments giue grace to the worthy Receiuer, that Faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are neceſſary, or what els can be thought of, as <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Diuine Faith,</hi> All, I ſay, and euery one Conſtitute the eſſence of Catholick Religion, and are known Doctrins of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Orthodox Church, in ſo much that the Proteſtant has no proper, <hi>Special,</hi> or peculiar Tenet of Religion left him at all (which is true) to propugn. And for this reaſon He is obliged hereafter, <hi>Iure humano, &amp; Diuino</hi> to write no more Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of <hi>Religion,</hi> wanting Matter to write of, And no less obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation lies on him to leaue off all further quarrelling in behalf of his improbable Opinions.

The old ſtrife is now on foot again: For as we call the particular Tenets of Proteſtants, <hi>Opinions,</hi> and <hi>improbable</hi> alſo, So they in like manner ſay, All that the Catholick Church maintains aboue the Common Doctrin of Chriſtians or the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>Creeds</hi> &amp;c, are only Church-Opinions, as improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as Theirs.

The reply ſetled vpon no Foundation is more than ſimple, For either theſe men Cauil becauſe we call their Negatiue Articles, <hi>Opinions,</hi> or Term them improbable <hi>Opinions.</hi> Sectaries themſelues call them <hi>Opinions,</hi> that's vnexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably plain, Though they know well that the Church neuer ſpeak's ſo meanly of her contrary Poſitiue Doctrins. The only difficulty remaining is, whether they are improbable or no? And this ſtands moſt clearly euidenced already vpon an <hi>vndeniable Principle.</hi> viz. That when Luther firſt broached them, They were oppoſite to the whole Orthodox world, And for that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe were then as improbable and Heteroclite as one Rebels vote is againſt à whole Kingdome, or as Arianiſm was againſt the Vniuerſal Church. Now ſince that time they haue gained no more Probability than Arianiſm, And ſo the old Improbability ſtill clings to them. And for this reaſon the Sectary is to find out à Catholick Church which defended his Negatiues, or any one ſpecifical Tenet of Proteſtancy, as <hi>Ancient,</hi> or, <hi>reputed as Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi> as our Church then was, or is now: Thus much done we will allow more to his Opinions than Probability.

VVhat force their conceſsion hath. VVhy they granted ſo much. The Argument is clearly propoſed. Mr Stillingfleet return's no probable Anſwer. A full diſcouery of his fallacies.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. SOme may think the particular Matter now hinted at too largely handled being ſcarce worth halfe the labour here ſpent vpon it, And They iudge right, Should I once ſo much as offer to proue, as Mr Stillingfleet fondly Imagin's, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church à ſafe way to ſaluation becauſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Say ſo. Far bee it from mee to entertain ſuch à Thought, For whether They ſide with vs, or not, Wee haue abſolute<note place="margin">Abſolute Certainty of Faith without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of Sectaries.</note> Certainty of our Faith independently of Their ſuffrages, or Voting vs in à Secure way to Heauen. Wherefore Should Sectaries recoile, And ſay wee are all damned (as ſome haue done) wee regard it not, That would no more Leſſen the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty wee now haue of ſound Faith, than Their Caſual Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs Saluation in the way wee are in, Heightens it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis true, were it doubtful (or no more but Probable) whether Catholicks Could bee ſaued in their Religion, The agreeing of Sectaries with vs might ſerue for ſomething, But now, when the Certainty of our Doctrin Stand's, as wee here Suppoſe moſt ſecure vpon an Infallible Principle (which is Church Authority) The Proof taken from the Agreement of both Parties is an Impertinency, And in real Truth, <hi>De ſubiecto
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102688:129"/> non ſupponente,</hi> That is, <hi>Not to bee ſuppoſed,</hi> if (which is euer to bee noted) wee should goe about to ſtrengthen our Catholick Doctrin, becauſe Heretiques Agree with vs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Howeuer, though the Agreement, Conſidered in it ſelfe, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> no more but à fallible Proteſtant Opinion, yet laid by the other indubitable Doctrin of the Catholick Church 'Tis à Truth as aſſerted by them, And ties their tongues ſo faſt, that They shall Neuer hereafter ſpeak à probable word againſt our Catholick Faith. Again, the Conceſſion preſſes Sectaries <hi>Ad hominem,</hi> who admit Scripture vpon the General Agreement of all Called Chriſtians. If therefore They argue well: <hi>Both you Catholicks and wee Proteſtants hold theſe books Diuine, Ergo,</hi> They are ſo. Wee Argue as ſtrongly: Both Parties alſo grant ſaluation to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,<note place="margin">An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them vpon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</note> ergo They are ſo ſecure, that it is impoſſible to plead againſt the Truth, Though as I ſaid now, The Sectaries Conceſſion heightens not one whit our Certainty, whereof you may ſee more n. 20. In the <hi>Interim</hi> pleaſe to know, The only reaſon why I diſcuſs this Controuerſy more at Large, is, firſt to diſcouer Mr Stillingfleets groſs fallacies, Next to Show that Proteſtants, are forced at laſt to Put an End to Controuerſies, Seeing the moſt Learned that euer wrote, ingenuouſly acknowledge the Roman Catholick Faith, to bee à ſafe, ſecure, and abundantly ſufficient Means to attain Saluation, which is to ſay, A true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing Catholick Cannot bee Damned vpon the Account of Wanting Faith, if other Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Duties bee Complyed with.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now if you Ask what forced Sectaries to grant thus much to Catholicks? I anſwer it was no kindness God knowes, But ſtark shame (to touch here on no other Motiue) which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted the Conceſſion from them, For would not both Heauen and earth haue Clamour'd had They damned all their own Anceſtors, all the learned and ignorant of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church far and neer extended, for want of Diuine Faith? Yet this followes, Becauſe without Faith <hi>it is impoſsible to pleaſe God.</hi> And thus they ſtand perplexed. Allow ſauing faith to the Roman Catholick, Their Plea is ended; Deny it; They ſend
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102688:129"/> millions and millions of Souls to Hell. Thus much premiſed. I Argue.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Faith which the Roman Catholick Church and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants<note place="margin">The Ground of our Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin.</note> alſo iointly own as ſufficient to bring à man to Heauen, is intirely perfect, And cannot be rationally oppoſed by either Party. But the Faith of à true belieuing Catholick is ſuch à Faith, Therefore it is entirely perfect, And cannot be more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Oppoſed. Now further. If it ſtand's thus firm vpon <hi>Church Authority</hi> (That's the certain Principle) And <hi>the Conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſsion of Aduerſaries</hi> As an <hi>ouer-meaſure</hi> (though weightles) it cannot be rationally excepted againſt by either, both Parties owning it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Saluation. Therefore All controuerſies concerning Faith are clearly ended in behalf of Catholicks, Vnless meer Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils may pass for rational Arguments.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is truly Pitiful to ſee how vainly Mr Stillingfleet. Part. 3. C. 4. Page. 611. ſtriues to Euert the force of this short Diſcourſe. Sometimes The difficulty is not ſo much as touched by him. Sometimes Hee miſtakes the Queſtion, And euer beggs it. Now He run's away with half à Principle, which lead's in à lame Concluſion. Now falſe Suppoſitions pass for Proofs. Now Proteſtant Opinions enter in, as ſound Doctrin. Here he wrong's our Catholick Authors, There He contradict's himſelfe. In à word you haue nothing through His whole fourth Chapter But I know not what ſtrange Confuſion. Thus He Begins.</p>

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102688:130"/> Church, becauſe it is à true Church in Fundamentals, And that the differences betweem them And vs are about leſſer Matters, or meer Opinions &amp;c. See Mr. Thorndicke in his Book of <hi>Forbearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</hi> page 19. Therefore Mr. Stillingfleets, lean, bare, and remote <hi>Poſsibility</hi> of Saluation, is only his own particular Opinion.<note place="margin">Proved weak and vnconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> Howeuer though he ſee's not the Conſequence, Wee haue enough to conclude againſt him. I'le s'hew you how.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There is, Saith he, A poſibility of being Saved in the Romam Catholick Faith, That is, Catholick Religion has in it à <hi>Poſsibility</hi> of bringing men to Heauen, if there be nothing wanting on Their parts. Very Good. This Poſſibility intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal To the Religion is now as actually in Being, as the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it Selfe, But the Religion is actually in being, Therefore this <hi>Poſsibility</hi> inſeparable from it, is alſo Actual, And lies not in the <hi>Series</hi> of things yet producible, as Creatures doe which God, if he pleaſe may Create to morrow. And thus you ſee, <hi>Poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> ſtand's here not oppoſite to <hi>non-Existency,</hi> but to an <hi>Actual impoſsibility,</hi> Therefore when I ſay, Catholick Religion <hi>now exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting</hi> can <hi>poſsibly</hi> ſaue All, I ſay with the ſame breath, <hi>it cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly damn Any.</hi> Unleſs you'l Grant it can ſaue <hi>All</hi> and damn ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, which is impoſſibile.</p>
               <p n="9">9.

               <p n="10">10. What followes in the Objection of our narrow eſcaping dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in Catholick Religion, as men doe with infinet danger in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102688:130"/> Shipwrack, is no more but Mr. Stillingfleets own improbable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, not worth refuting, And His reaſon is far worſe. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>

Now if you ſay we haue indeed à kind of Faith, but ſo defectiue that it beget's no Repentance no piety &amp;c. You ſpeak only your fancy, deſtroy the very Eſſence of Faith,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102688:132"/> And Conſequently the Catholick muſt at laſt be damned for want of Faith, or, if you make the Errours ſo minute as not to raſe out <hi>Sauing</hi> Faith, that ſtands in being ſtill, ſo do other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian virtues likewiſe, and Saluation with them.

Sr, theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties worth examination, And throughly Canuaſed by others, are in this place impertinencies, Therefore though you would lead me aſtray, yet I'le not follow you, But press you to Anſwer directly to the point in hand. Giue me à man, For example, An humble S.

                     </gap>ffering Parties agree on.</hi> Anſw. 1. Here is no Agreement concerning the main point of Saluation, For the Catholicks and Donatiſts <hi>iointly</hi> and <hi>vnanimouſly</hi> neuer openly Confeſſed that Catholicks could be ſaued, as now we and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants by one conſent ſay it. But let that pass. 2. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks<note place="margin">To no purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.</note> and Donatiſts agreed that Baptiſm adminiſtred by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks was valid and good. That's true Doctrin. But both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties neuer agreed, that it was lawful for à Catecumen to take Baptiſm from the Donatiſts, vnless in Caſe of neceſſity. See <hi>S Auſtin</hi> Lib. 1. de Bapt. c. 2. 3. O, but thus much followes. The Donatiſts Baptiſm is more ſafe than that of Catholicks vpon this Principle, That both Parties agree'd ſo far, and it is ſafeſt to take that way wherein differing Parties agree, conſequently the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks Baptiſm is less ſafe, becauſe the Donatiſts denied it to be true.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Anſw: This whole Diſcourſe is à meer Paralogiſm; the Fallacy lies here, That the Opinion of diſſenting men is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">A Paralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm anſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red.</note> to Add more ſecurity, more certainty to Church-Doctrin, than the Doctrin it ſelf deriues from that Oracle of Truth. I ſay Contrary. As ſuch Opinions, when true, Add no more weight or certainty to that Doctrin than it had antecedently from the<note place="margin">The Funda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mental ground of our Anſwer.</note> Church, So if false; They make not the Doctrin less certain. Take one inſtance, God reueals this Truth. <hi>The Diuine word aſſumed Humane nature.</hi> One preaches the Truth but Adds no degree of certainty to the Doctrin <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> which in the higheſt degree was moſt certain, before his Preaching. An other falſly
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102688:133"/> (as Arius did) oppoſes the verity, it is not Therefore less cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it ſelf becauſe He contradicts it. And thus we diſcourſe of our Church Tenets, indubitably moſt certain vpon Church Authority, whether Hereticks <hi>deny</hi> or <hi>grant,</hi> (That Matters not) the Doctrin ſtand's firm ſtill as before, And as we ſee by daily experience neither riſeth higher in certainty, nor fall's lower in the iudgement of Catholicks, becauſe Sectaries ſide with it, or bend againſt it.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Thus much proued The Paralogiſm is at an end. The Catholicks held The Donatiſts Baptiſm valid; ſo they would haue done had theſe Hereticks duely Miniſtred it, and with all (which is poſſible) afterward denied it valid, So independent Church Doctrin is of diſſenting mens opinions. The Donatiſts again ſlighted our Catholick Baptiſm, the Church regards it not, For as the Opinions of the Goodnes of their own Baptiſm <hi>heightned</hi> not the Churches <hi>certainty</hi> concerning it, So their Contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of its inſufficiency made not the Truth less certain to the Catholick. Apply what is here noted to our preſent caſe, and you will ſee the like Concluſion. Proteſtants Say, we may be<note place="margin">Sectaries Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with vs neither Leſſens nor increaſes our Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> ſaued in Catholick Religion. The Opinion is true, But as aſſerted by them is no more but an Opinion, which therefore Add's not one grain of more Certainty to Catholick Doctrin, For had they denied vs à poſsibility of Saluation, as now by meer Chance they grant it, Catholicks would haue giuen as little eare to That, as They now doe to their many other falſe Opinions. So it is? Church Doctrin as I now ſaid, neither fall's nor riſeth in certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, vpon the account of our Sectaries Opinions.</p>
               <p n="23">23. You will Ask what then gain we by the Conceſsion of Proteſtants when it giues vs no more Aſſurance in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, than we had before from the Church? I haue anſwered abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue. We gain thus much, That they cannot rationally impugn any Catholick Doctrin without contradicting Them ſelues, For if confeſſedly, This bring's men to Heauen, the Religion is ſound, And implies no eſſential Errour, The conceſsion then, as I ſaid, ſerues well as an Argument <hi>ad Hominem</hi> to ſtop the mouths of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102688:134"/> Sectaries, And showes withall, That they end controuerſies For its<note place="margin">What their Exceſſion Serues for?</note> horridly vniuſt to diſpute againſt à Faith which all grant ſaues ſouls. We pretend no more, nor can pretend it, And here is the Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="23">23. No Catholick (nor indeed any other) doth or can belieue à Chriſtian Verity vpon this ground or Motiue, that Sectaries ſay its true, for their ſaying ſo, is neither Gods Reuelation nor the Churches Doctrin, But à meer Opinion as taught by them, But an opinion (chiefly theirs) is to weak to ground any faith vpon, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I belieue, as I do, Saluation moſt ſafe in the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, I belieue it vpon à Motiue totally diſtinct from the Proteſtants Aſſertion. It is true, their Aſſertion or ſiding with vs may induce one to reflect on the great power Truth has in working vpon men moſt refractory, Though it Adds no new degree of certainty to Catholick Doctrin. I haue inſiſted lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vpon this point becauſe it vtterly deſtroies what euer Mr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet can ſay againſt vs, vnless he will quarrel vpon this ſcore, that I here ſuppoſe my Church Doctrin moſt certain, which is not the Queſtion now, But may well be ſuppoſed in all good law of diſputation, And shall, God willing, be proued in the next Diſcourſe.</p>

If that be the ſafeſt which both Parties agree in, the Principle makes much for the Aduantage of Proteſtants, And why?

We put the real Preſence or local being of Chriſt in the very Obiect before our eyes vpon the Altar, you put it in your faith, or Fancy rather. Hence your queſtion afterward viz. <hi>Whether we do not allow any real and Spiritual preſence of Chriſt beſides the Corporal</hi> (you mean the Real) manducation, is ſoon anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, For we diſtinguish what you confound together, And ſay, if by theſe Terms <hi>Spiritual Preſence</hi> you would exclude the <hi>real obiectiue Preſence</hi> of Chriſts ſacred body, we diſſent from you, And abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly hold that Real obiectiue Preſence, which may be rightly <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Spiritual</hi> becauſe by it Chriſt is placed <hi>Totus in toto, totally in the whole hoſt and totally in euery part of it.</hi> Contrariwiſe, if you make it only à fancied Preſence of Chriſt, or ſay, Hee is not really vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Forms or Accidents of bread, wee leaue that lean Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie Doctrin to you, vtterly disanow it, and ſtill diſſent from you.</p>

I ſay this Propoſition. <hi>Saluation may be had in Catholick Religion,</hi> is So true, that it cannot be falſe, becauſe the greateſt Authority on earth, the vniuerſal Church of Chriſt own's it as an vndoubted verity, and could this <hi>poſsibly</hi> be à falshood, neither we nor Proteſtants can belieue any thing which the Church teaches, as is amply proued in the ſecond Diſcourſe. &amp;c.

You Anſwer, that Chriſt was of <hi>the like nature.</hi> Very good. <hi>That Likeneſs</hi> either excluded the <hi>ſame nature</hi> or included it; Grant the firſt, you make the Fathers Hereticks, which is impoſſible, For they held the ſame nature <hi>common</hi> and <hi>Conſubstantial</hi> to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son. If their conceſſion (which is true) included the ſame nature, The Orthodox party and Arians agreed not in the ſame hypotheſis, conſequently your inſtance is to no purpoſe at all. In à word this euer and vnexceptionably holds good. The Doctrin which Hereticks Iewes and Turks agree in with Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks is moſt true (ſo you and we agree about ſaluation now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed) but it doth not follow, that ſo much <hi>only,</hi> or that <hi>no more is true.</hi> Your want of reflecting vpon this <hi>Only</hi> or, <hi>no More</hi> makes<note place="margin">That's truth wherein Catholicks and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks agree.</note> all your inſtances impertinent And your inferences <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest holding with the Arians</hi> moſt vnconcluding; For though the Doctrin be true when the <hi>Arian</hi> ſide with the Church, yet it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riues no abſolute ſafety from that conſent of Hereticks.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Vpon theſe grounds all the reſt which followes fall's to nothing. <hi>Some diſſenting parties</hi> (Say you) agree that there ought <hi>to be à Reſurrection from Sin, and that this Reſurrection is meant in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers paſſages of Scripture, But they deny the Reſurrection of the body after Death. Ergo it will be the Safest to deny the article of the Reſurrection.</hi> Again: <hi>Diſſenting parties, as Iewes, Turcks, and Sectaries agree with
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102688:136"/> Catholicks, that there is but one God,</hi> Ergo <hi>by virtue of this Principle, men will be bound to deny the Trinity.</hi> Laſtly. <hi>Diſſenting parties Agree fully with vs That Christ is man; but Hereticks deny His Godhead. Therefore it will be ſafest belieuing that Christ is meer man, And not God.</hi> Anſwer. With much weariſomness do I read theſe more than pitiful improbable inferences. Not one of them ariſes from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which lead in any thing like your Concluſion. Reduce but<note place="margin">Premiſes put which infer no Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> one to right Form (one ſerues for all) and you will ſee your folly. Thus it is. <hi>That Doctrin in which Catholicks and Hereticks agree is ſafe and true Doctrin; Catholicks and Hereticks agree in this Doctrin that Chriſt is man (but not man only</hi>) ergo <hi>that is ſafe and true Doctrin.</hi> Here is the utmoſt your Premiſes can infer, And I grant all. <hi>Chriſt is truly man.</hi> So I grant the Doctrin of à Reſurrection from ſin, of one God only to be moſt ſound and Catholick, But here is your grand miſtake and open fallacy with it. You ſeem to perſwade the Reader, that becauſe Hereticks agree ſo far with the Church, Therefore it is ſafe to deny what euer other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin She maintains. Sr, She maintains the Truths now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet not <hi>only Thoſe</hi> But many more And herein there is no Agreement, conſequently no good concluſion for you vpon any <hi>agreed Principle.</hi> For thus much only followes from thence, <hi>That ſo far as we Agree, ſo far true Doctrin is taught.</hi> Apply this to our preſent matter and all is plain. You and we agree thus far, that Saluation may be had in the Roman Catholick Religion. Moſt true. We diſſent from you concerning the Charge of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note place="margin">An ather fallacy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.</note> and groſs Errours impoſed on vs, from this you can infer no Concluſion againſt vs vpon the Principle of Agreement, now Suppoſed in the other Doctrin <hi>of Saluation,</hi> which goes on roundly without all contradiction. I would ſay. We agree about Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and that's à Truth; we differ in other points, here we muſt diſpute <hi>vpon other Grounds,</hi> And lay that agreed on Principle aſide, for immediatly it lead's in no concluſion in ſuch matters.</p>

If men muſt be ſaued in the true Church (be it yet where you will) And in this we All agree, none can in conſcience call the Doctrin of it Topical or vncertain, as shall be proued afterward. In the mean while Say I beſeech you,<note place="margin">Church Doctrin Miſcalled Topical.</note> what ſafer Principle haue you to rely on in this weightly matter of Saluation, which will not be more Topical Than that is which the true Church teaches, And you approue. You know, or should know there was neuer any true Church ſince Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity began, which denied Saluation to the Romam Catholick. Nay all Orthodox Chriſtians euer granted it. You ſide with all theſe Orthodox Chriſtians and what greater Authority can there be on earth? Yet this Principle muſt be called by you <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical and vncertain.</hi> Say then what's more certain? Will you lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the voice and vote of all Orthodox Profeſſors and run to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Alas, The whole book Saith no where ſo much as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly, That you Proteſtants are in the <hi>Safe way of Saluation,</hi> And we Catholicks not. What euer Argument therefore is drawn from Scripture, will be à leſſe ſatisfactory Principle (yea none at all) And infinitly more Topical in order to <hi>ſaue you,</hi> Than what the church teaches, and you hold with it, is, <hi>to ſave vs.</hi> Now if you let goe this Principle of plain Scripture, as you muſt (or I'le vrge you lo produce that plain Text which <hi>ſaues
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102688:138"/> you,</hi> and <hi>Damn's Catholicks</hi>) you haue nothing left to ſtand on but meer Miſinterpretations and Gloſſes, which indeed merit not ſo much as very name of <hi>Topicks.</hi>

They cannot deny what they neuer heard off. But let this pass. I Anſwer. 2.

C. 1. 2. 3. That none of you hitherto haue dared to Anſwer. The proof briefly is reduced to this plain Diſcourſe.

               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Principle. Thoſe want the means leading to the laſt happy End, who are Aliens from the true Church of Chriſt, or Separated from that Catholick Society. The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo plainly deliuered not only by moſt Ancient Fathers, But by the more learned Sectaries alſo, That it is needleſſ to produce many Teſtimonies. S. Cyprian. <hi>Lib. de unitate Eccleſiae?</hi> Saith. <hi>Quisquis ab Eccleſia ſeparatus est &amp;c.</hi> Who euer is ſeparated from the Church is ioyned to an Adultereſs, And diuorced from all the Promiſſes of the Church. <hi>He comes not to the reward which Chriſt has promiſed who leaues the Church of Chriſt. He is an Alien, Prophane an Enemy, and cannot haue God for his Father, who hath not the Church for his Mother.</hi> S. Auſtin. <hi>lib. 4. de Symb.</hi> C. 13. Speaks fully this ſenſe Citing thoſe laſt words of Cyprian. <hi>And Lib. 4. de Baptis.</hi> C. 17. Saith. <hi>Out of the Church there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi> Yet more: <hi>Epiſt. 152. Whoeuer is or shall be ſeparated from</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Fathers Teſtimonies preduced.</note> 
                  <hi>this Catholick Church, although he thinks himſelf to liue moſt lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, For this one wickednes alone, that he is disioyned from the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, shall haue no life, Sed ira Dei manet ſuper eum,</hi> But the wrath of God remains vpon him. S. Fulgentius <hi>Lib. de

Colum: with me. 785. extra quam omnes interibant,</hi> out of which Ark All dyed, and all are damned who are out of the Church. Again <hi>In Caput. 9. ad</hi>

                  <hi>Galat. Thoſe who are not members of the viſible Church,</hi> are not members of the Catholick Church. Humfred. <hi>Ad Ration. 3.

C.</hi> 1. 4. makes it abſolutly neceſſary to be in vnion with Chriſts viſible Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ground of this Truth is ſo ſolidly laid down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that none can contradict it, For here the Church is called <hi>the Kingdom, the Body, the Inheritance of Christ,</hi> purchaſed at à dear<note place="margin">The Ground of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Truth</note> rare, the effuſion of his ſacred blood, <hi>A Citty built vpon à Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> The <hi>Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, the <hi>Hieruſalem, the Pillar</hi> and <hi>firmament of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby it appears, That whoeuer is out of this Kingdom, out of this Citty, out of this houſe and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; whoeuer is not à member of this Myſtical body or shares not in this <hi>purchaſed Inheritance,</hi> or in à word out of the true Church (be it where you will, I yet define nothing) is in à damnable condition. A ſad thought for all Sectaries, becauſe it is certain, that Chriſt has not compoſed his Church of ſuch Members as rightly belieue the reuealed Doctrin taught by the true Church, and of ſuch as oppoſe it. Vnity and Diuiſion in<note place="margin">Vnity and Diuiſion in Faith haue no place in the true Church.</note> points of Faith ase inconſiſtent in the ſame Orthodox Church, and deſtroy the eſſential forme of it, which is one Faith. Now if our Aduerſaries talk of à vnity in Fundamentals, they are not only euidently conuinced of Errour in the other Treatiſe, But vpon this very Account become <hi>Separaters</hi> from the Church,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102688:141"/> and without Principles Aſſert that which neither Church nor Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches. <hi>Who euer hold's not the Catholick faith entire shall Perish eternally,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Creed, but an entire Belief excludes all diſtinction between fundamentals and others, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. I little value ſome Proteſtants Gloſſes made vpon this Text, for Gloſſes with me are weightles, when they ſtand vnprinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The 3. Principle. What the true Church of Chriſt teaches concerning the ſenſe of Scripture, That's the ſenſe intended by the Holy Ghoſt, and Conſequently moſt true. The reaſon is. <hi>Truth cannot be contrary to truth,</hi> The Church and Scripture neuer Clash, But alwaies ſpeak one and the ſame verity. This Sectaries muſt grant, who define the Church to be <hi>an Aſſembly of men profeſsing the pure Word of God, Therefore it cannot deceiue or teach an Errour contrary to that pure word, Or if it doth ſo, it ceaſeth, eo ipſo,</hi> to be God's Oracle, And the true Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If theſe men ſtill go on trifling with their wonted diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of Fundamentals, and not Fundamentals, And allow à Perfect vnity of Doctrin between the Church and Scripture in<note place="margin">The Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals and others, friuolous.</note> things abſolutly neceſſary to Saluation, but not in others. This is to define, and not to define, to build and deſtroy, to teach and cheat in one breath, For à definition, which makes known the nature of à Thing, muſt ſtand in its open ſenſe without reſtraint, and exactly agree to the thing defined. Mark now. Chriſts true Church is the <hi>Thing defined;</hi> and the Definition charged with endless reſtrictiue Terms, is drawn to Non-ſenſe, fot it tells vs, the Church is an Aſſembly of men profeſſing the pure Word of God, But how far? In à few ſimple Truths, called fundamentals, in others it may err, and profess as much falshood as you pleaſe <hi>againſt the Verities of Scripture,</hi> So that the true Church, not defined at all, is made by theſe, à fair and foul Spouſe at once; fair in à few vnalterable neceſſary Truths, but foul, vgly, and deformed (becauſe erroneous) in à hundred other matters. Mark the Paradox, and call it à flat Hereſy, which ſeparat's him who aſſert's it from the Catholick body. Thus it is. Chriſts Church is true,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:102688:142"/> and falfe, pure and vnpure, right and wrong, louely and hateful together. The Inhabitants of this Citty of God, of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſafe dwelling place, are in it by belieuing à few ſimple Truths, And at the ſame time out of it, by belieuing more Falſities. This is Mr Stillingfleets ſtrange Doctrin, who think's there is no Church now in the world of one Denomination free from Errour. To what deſperate improbabilities doth Hereſy driue men?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The 4. Principle. The receiued Doctrin of Chriſts Church, chiefly in all points of Controuerſy is euer as clear, and often more clear, by what She teaches, than it is in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words of Scripture. The Aſſertion is vndubitable. For<note place="margin">Church Doctrin clear in the Churches Definitions.</note> who ſee's not, but that the whole Catholick Doctrin, of the ſacred Trinity, of one God and three diſtinct Perſons, of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improduced, the eternal Son begotten, and of the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from both, is more plainly deliuered in Church Doctrin, than in any ſentence, or ſentences of Holy Writ. The like I ſay of the high Godhead in Chriſt, which the Arians deny; Of Original ſin, reiected by the Pelagians, and other Articles of our Chriſtian faith. And thus much is euident againſt Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, for do not they make their own Doctrin, of their <hi>Caen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And will they not alſo grant (T'is an Argument ad hominem) that our Catholick Tenet of this ſacred Myſtery, laid forth in the Council of Trent. <hi>Sess. 13. Can.</hi> 1. is more expreſs and plain Popery than lies couched in Chriſts own words <hi>This is my body,</hi> Though the Popery is there clear enough to euery Reader? Yes moſt aſſuredly, For if our Doctrin ſtand as plain in Chriſts words, as in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Definition drawn from thence, Sectaries cannot (as they do) admit of the one and ſcornfully reiect the other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt ſuppoſe Scripture more dark and obſcure, than either their own, or our Churches Doctrin is. And hence it followes that the very Arians were not ſo much Hereticks vpon the account, that they oppoſed any moſt clear and expreſs
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:102688:142"/> ſentence in Holy writ (for really it's hard to find one <hi>manifeſtly expreſs</hi> againſt them), as for contradicting plain Church Doctrin, or the true ſenſe of Scripture deliuered by this Oracle of truth. Their Hereſy then proceeded firſt from ſome words in Scripture ſeemingly clear in their behalf, as, <hi>My Father is greater than</hi> 1. 2. From no Text ſo manifeſt, but that ſtill place was left them to<note place="margin">Why the Arians were accounted Heretiques.</note> Gloſſe as they haue done, and in their Iudgements with ſome appearrance of truth, yet Hereticks they were and ſo deſerue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly accounted of, for contradicting the Church's clear Doctrin. Be it how you will, thus much I am ſure of, They neuer man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled or miſuſed any paſſage in holy Writ, when contrary to their Hereſy more shamfully, than our Proteſtants now mangle and abuſe our Sauiours Propoſition. <hi>This is my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. By all you ſee this Principle well grounded. <hi>Whateuer Clarity Scripture hath chiefly in Matters of controuerſy</hi> (and clarity helps much in the Rule of Faith) <hi>Gods true Church, which cannot but ſpeak the Scriptures ſenſe, in euery particular, deliuers it moſt clearly,</hi> Wherefore S. <hi>Austin</hi> told Manicheus, <hi>Tom: 6. contra Epiſt: Fundam.</hi> C. 14. That if hee was to belieue the obſcure Myſteries of Chriſtianity, Hee would aſſent to them vpon the weighty Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of People and Nations celebrated and ſpread abroad, By the conſent of all learned, and vnlearned, which conſent implies the vniuerſal Agreement of the Catholick Church, And to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish this Doctrin more firmly, He aſſures vs. <hi>Tract. 18. in Ioan:</hi> That all Hereſy which intangles ſouls and caſt's them into Hell,<note place="margin">S.

Hence alſo Hee told vs aboue, <hi>Lib. 1. contra Creſcon. C.</hi> 32. That if any doubt ariſe concerning the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of Scripture we are to haue recourſe to Chriſts holy Church, and receiue from Her ſatisfaction. To which purpoſe, <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks moſt piouſly. <hi>Lib. de Vnit:</hi> Eccleſiae. <hi>illius lacté nutrimur Spiritu eius animamur, adulterari non poteſt ſponſa Christi.</hi> We are nourished by the milk, we are animated by the Spirit of this faithful Spouſe of Chriſt, which cannot play the Harlot, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Adulteress.</p>

                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:102688:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>8. The laſt Principle. The Rule of Faith is plain, or its own Self-euidence, apt of its own nature to conuince the moſt obſtinate Aduerſary, whether Iew, Gentil or Heretick, And for this reaſon muſt be immediatly credible by it Self, and for it ſelf, otherwiſe it muſt ſuppoſe an other diſtinct Rule yet more plain, more euident, more conuincing and more immediatly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, And that Rule à third, à fourth, And ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> which is impoſſible. Again, the Obiectiue Rule we Shall now ſpeak of, Anſwer's to the thing regulated by it, which is true, certain, and Diuine Faith. This Rule then muſt not only be true, and certain in it ſelf, but alſo certainly applyed to Belieuers, For à cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note place="margin">What the Rule of Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies?</note> Rule in it ſelf dubiouſly applyed to an vnderſtanding, auail's only to leaue all in Suſpence and lead's none to any further Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcency, but to à wauering and vncertain Opinion, And this is neither ſuitable to firm Belief, nor to the Rule it ſelf, which ought to eſtablish vs in Gods reuealed truths, without doubt and heſitancy. Grant this Notion of à Rule to be exact (and none shall iuſtly except againſt it) All we haue ſaid aboue of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Inſufficiency, to regulate Faith, or to decide controuerſies, is no less than à Demonſtration againſt Sectaries, Whereof ſee more in the other Treatiſe? Diſc. 2. <hi>per totum.</hi> Scripture Certainly is not plain in all things neceſſary to be belieued, for were the true ſenſe of it (which indeed is only Scripture) as plain and indiſputably clear for the Arians, or Proteſtants in euery particular controuerſy, as their Doctrin is plainly deliuered by them; Or contrariwiſe; were the ſenſe of it as plain and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably clear for the Catholick Doctrin in Matters of debate, as the very Doctrin is taught by the Church, All Contention would ſoon ceaſe, becauſe either They, vpon the Suppoſition, muſt become Papiſts, or wee turn Arians and Proteſtants, Or finally be forced to deny plain Scripture. A moſt conuincing Argument.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The difficulty therefore is not (and Sectaries ſeldom touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it) whether Scripture be true, were the ſenſe known or out of Controuerſy, but what that true ſenſe is, which lies in obſcurity, and cannot be known, without à certain Interpreter. Here is
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:102688:143"/> the only Queſtion debated between vs and Sectaries. One may<note place="margin">The only difficulty concerning Scripture.</note> Reply. It is no good obiection to ſay learned men differ about the ſenſe of Scripture, Ergo it is not ſufficiently plain, becauſe à great wit may wreſt the plaineſt words God euer ſpake to à ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſenſe. Contra. 1. But who knowes, when two learned Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties conteſt in this Matter, which of them is the ſiniſter Wreſter? Contra 2. When à whole Society of men as the Arians were, and Proteſtants are now, Tamper with à Text, which touches an eſſential point of Faith, And diſſent from others as learned as Themſelues about the meaning, The ſenſe cannot be ſuppoſed more clear for the one than the other, without an other Rule certain and Definitiue. Pray you ſay. Is the ſenſe of thoſe words. <hi>My Father is greater than I,</hi> indiſputably clear for the Arian? Or the ſenſe of Chriſts words. <hi>This is my Body</hi> without controuerſy clear for the Proteſtants Doctrin concerning the Sacrament, when à whole learned Church oppoſeth both? Euidently No. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Sectaries muſt ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge an Obſcurity in Scripture.</note> our Nouelliſts muſt grant, that Scripture is not only obſcure, in theſe two places, But more; That à Iudge is neceſſary to aſcertain all of its true meaning, as well in theſe, as in à hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other Paſſages. Again, if Scripture want this clarity, it cannot be its own Self-euidence, much less conuince an obdurate Aduerſary. Nay I ſay, though it were clear and the ſenſe thereof agreed on by all called Chriſtians, yet both Iewes and Gentils ſcorn the Diuinity of the book, And ſay if't be of Diuine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, That muſt be proued by à certain Rule extrinſecal to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Therefore it is not immediatly credible <hi>by it ſelf, or for it ſelf.</hi> Laſtly were Scripture plain in it ſelf, yet (And this vtterly ruin's Sectaries) The certain Doctrin of it, can neuer be applyed indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably to any vnderſtanding, For our Nouelliſts ſay, becauſe all Teachers of Chriſtian Doctrin are fallible, none can make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Application of it to any, or teaeh that Doctrin infallibly, which is in it ſelf infallible.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Rule of Faith aſsigned: The Properties of à Rule. VVhat is meant by the Church? Ancient Fathers Aſſert that the Church is eaſily found out. Her marks, more clear, than Her Eſſential Doctrin</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe true Church of Chriſt in this preſent State mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly demonſtrable by ſignal Marks and Motiues, is the only plain, certain, Self-euident Rule of Faith, apt to conuince the moſt obdurate: Vnbelieuer. It is immediatly credible, and the Doctrin of it certainly applyed to à Seeker after truth. Theſe Aſſertions ſtand firm vpon 3. Principles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 1. Chriſt Ieſus has prouided Chriſtians of à clear and eaſy Rule, otherwiſe All are left in darknes, and know not what, or how to belieue.</p>

               <p n="4">4. 3. All the properties of à Rule exactly agree to the Church of Chriſt and to Her only. 1. The Rule of Faith is plain,<note place="margin">Chriſts Church is the Rule of Faith.</note> ſo is Church Doctrin and much more plain than Scripture; I mean, we eaſily vnderſtand what the Church teaches though the Doctrin in it ſelf be difficult. 2. A Rule is its own Self-euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, ſo the Church is, taken with the Marks, and Motiues whereby She is demonſtrated. 3. A Rule is apt to conuince, the moſt obſtinate Aduerſaries; Chriſts Church has euidently don ſo, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the innumerable Conuerſions wrought by Her vpon Iewes,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102688:144"/> Gentils, and moſt obdurate Hereticks. 4. A Rule muſt be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and certainly applyed to Belieuers; what Chriſts true Church teaches is ſo, for She is Gods own Oracle, as shall be proued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and teaches her Children infallibly. The Truth of theſe particulars will be more fully laid forth in the ſequele of this Diſcourſe. In the mean while, two things are to be cleared. The firſt, what we vnderſtand by the Church of Chriſt. 2. How and by what means She may be known? Thus much done, we shall eaſily find out thoſe Chriſtians, who are Members of this happy Society, or eſſentially conſtitute that viſible moral Body, called the Holy Catholick Church.<note place="margin">What is meant by the Church.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Concerning the firſt. We ſpeak plainly, and vnderſtand by the Church à viſible Society of true Belieuers, vnited in one profeſſion of Chriſtian Faith and the communication of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vnder the Conduct and Gouerment of Chriſt's lawful Commiſſioned Paſtors. I ſay no more yet, hoping no Sectary can iuſtly quarrel with the Notion of à Church, expreſſed in ſuch general Terms, And therefore waue at preſent that other worn-out controuerſy agitated by Proteſtants. viz. Whether the Predeſtinate only make vp the true Church, or great Sinners alſo may be included, That is not at all to our purpoſe now, when we only ſeek after à Society of Chriſtians vnited in the true Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, who owne à due ſubmiſſion to lawful Commiſſioned Paſtors, whether thoſe who teach, or are taught, be Saints, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, concerns them, t'is true, but not our preſent Queſtion. Of ſuch Belieuers there cannot be two or more Churches, but one only; And to auoid all confuſion, or the mingling of different Queſtions together, we here moue no doubt concerning the Head,<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the question propoſed.</note> or chief Authority of this Church, but immediattly Ask, whether there is now, and has euer been, ſince Chriſts time, à viſible diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Society of Chriſtians, who haue faithfully belieued the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Doctrin of Chriſt, and vpon that Account well merit to be called the Profeſſors of the true Catholick Church? Of this Vniuerſal ſpread Society our Sauiour ſpake moſt clearly, or of none. <hi>Hell gates Can not preuail againſt it. The Spirit of Truth abides with
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102688:145"/> it to the end of the world &amp;c.</hi> I think no Sectary will deny ſuch à Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The only difficulty now is to find out this Orthodox and large diffuſed Body of Chriſtians, vnited in one true Faith, and the ſincere Worship of God. And nothing is more conſonant to reaſon, more expreſs in Holy Writ, or more clearly aſſerted by the ancient Fathers than that the true Church laies forth Her own euidence or clear Diſcernibility whereby She is diſtinguished from all Heretical Sects, That is, She lies manifeſtly open to all eyes, and Cannot but bee moſt eaſily known. <hi>She is à Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Christ almost euery where was preached, by the Prophets in ſome hidden or couered Myſtery, Eccleſia apertè,</hi> but the Church was pointed at ſo clearly that all might ſee it, and thoſe alſo who were to bee againſt it. I waue other Authorities, for t'is tedious to proue à Manifeſt Truth, or here
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102688:145"/> to tranſcribe plainer Teſtimonies relating to this ſubiect. Thus much premiſed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I ſay firſt. Though Church Doctrin be more clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Church chiefly in all Matters of Controuerſy, than in Scripture; For example: you know the Church deliuers the<note place="margin">An Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Church Doctrin.</note> 
                  <hi>Conſubstantiallity</hi> of the eternal Son, with greater clarity than Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſeth that Truth, Yet no man can proue to reaſon this clearer Doctrin to be immediatly true, vpon this ſole ground, (Mark my preciſe words) <hi>that the Church teaches it. My meaning is.</hi> The Church yet not manifeſted to bee God's Oracle by marks extrinſecal to its Doctrin, leaues Reaſon ſo in ſuſpence that it Cannot ſay. <hi>This is the Oracle which teaches Truth,</hi> or, that the Doctrin of this not yet euidenced Society is Diuine, and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox. The Aſſertion is ſo amply proued aboue that it is needles to press the Arguments further in this place. All I ſay now, is, that we diſcourſe in like manner of Scripture and Church Doctrin preciſely conſidered as <hi>Eſſential Doctrin,</hi> not yet made Credible <hi>by</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Doctrin of Scripture, or The Church, not Proued true by Saying its true.</note> 
                  <hi>ſignes and Motiues.</hi> As therefore the Verities of Scripture, are not known to be Diuine <hi>Ex terminis,</hi> becauſe I read them in that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly book, But muſt haue them proued Diuine vpon à certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple diſtinct from Scripture, So the Verities of the Church are not known <hi>Ex terminis</hi> to be certain, before I proue the Church by Clear Motiues to be the Oracle of Truth whereby God ſpeaks to Chriſtians. what I Aſſert is euident in Chriſt our Lord and his Apoſtles, when they firſt began to preach, For neither Iew, nor Gentil belieued that Sacred Doctrin vpon their bare prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, Nay, It ſcandalized the one, and ſeemed à foolery to the other, But when they ſaw it confirmed by Euident Signes and Wonders, by eminent Sanctity of life, by vndeniable Miracles, and other Signal marks which the Author of Religion laid open to Reaſon, Both Iewes and Gentils, were gained, moued to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue by Such Inducements no less prudent than forceably perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The reaſon of all <hi>à Priori</hi> giuen aboue, euinces thus much: None can indubitably and immediatly own the Doctrin of either
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102688:146"/> Church, or Scripture as true and Orthodox but by one of theſe two means. Either the light of natural Reaſon diſcouers that Truth, Or it muſt be known by Faith. Reaſon alone, too weak to comprehend the Sublime Myſteries reuealed in Holy writ or taught by the Church, boggles at all, And, left to it ſelf, reiects<note place="margin">The reaſon of our Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> at leaſt the harder Myſteries, as is manifeſt in both Iewes, and Gentils. Now to know them by obſcure Faith is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, vnless one haue ſufficient Aſſurance before hand, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on other prudent extrinſecal Principles, That both Scripture, and the Church teach Diuine, and certain Doctrin. To know thus much, the Rational man muſt diſcourſe And in this preſent ſtate of things, firſt find out the Church, by her Marks, and Signes viſible to all. If reaſon complies not with this duty, the Faith we draw from thence is no Faith, but, à precipitous foolish Credulity. For who can prudently aſſent to the high Myſteries of Chriſtianity, vnlesse Reaſon firſt ſee it is prudent to do ſo? This is what the Apoſtle deliuer's in few but moſt pithy words. <hi>Scio cui credidi, &amp; certus ſum.</hi> That is, I firſt know why I am to belieue by Reaſon, and then ſtedfaſtly belieue without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſoning. But enough of this in the Chapter cited aboue.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The. 2. Propoſition. If the Doctrin of Chriſt's Church preciſely conſidered according to <hi>its Eſſence,</hi> bee not <hi>ex exterminis</hi> manifeſtly true, or proues not immediatly that the Church is Orthodox vpon Her own meer ſaying that She teaches Truth; It is euident, She muſt be proued Gods Oracle by Motiues, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal to Her Doctrin. Now theſe Motiues purely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>as Inducements to belieue,</hi> are not Articles of Faith, but <hi>ſenſible, reaſonable,</hi> and of ſuch weight, that they powerfully incline euery<note place="margin">The Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt proued Orthodox by rational Motiues.</note> well diſpoſed vnderſtanding to this rational aſſent. <hi>As God ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpake</hi> by <hi>Moſes, by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles,</hi> So he now alſo ſpeak's by his own true Church, And lead's men vnder her ſafe Conduct to Saluation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The ground of my Aſſertion, is no less euident, than the very Poſition it ſelfe. Firſt, Chriſt himſelf neuer proued his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102688:146"/> true by meerly ſaying it was ſo, but confirmed it by ſignes and wonders which made it immediatly credible as is ſayd already, So alſo did his Apoſtles, And ſo doth the true Church to this day. 2. Vnless Chriſtians haue thoſe prudent <hi>Inducements</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiouſly applied to reaſon before they belieue the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, The wiſe prouidence of God muſt be ſuppoſed ſo neglectiue, as not to let men know after à prudent and diligent ſearch, which or where his true Church is, Though Scripture Compares it to à glorious Sun, moſt viſible to all And the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, they are blind that ſee it not. 3. All thoſe Millions of Chriſtians who belieued the true Church, who liued and dyed happily in it, (innumerable shed their blood for the verities of it) were not à People mad nor beſotted vpon this Account, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<note place="margin">As the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Chriſtians more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, ſo are wee.</note> They proceeded iuſt as the Primitiue Chriſtians did, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies belieued vpon Rational Motiues. Theſe Motiues then firſt enlightned the reaſon of the moſt ancient Chriſtians, And reaſon afterward preuented by grace, ſubmitted to all the Church teaches. But much more of this hereafter, becauſe of greateſt Conſequence, though it ſeem's Sectaries haue little regard to the Euidence of Chriſtianity Drawn from rational Motiues.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The. 3. Propoſition. The Marks of Chriſts Church manifeſt to all, are more ſenſible and clear than the eſſential Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin is, marked by them; They are peculiar to the true Church only, and diſtinguish Her from all Heretical Communities; Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally taken all together, and not by Piece-meal, conuince this truth. <hi>That God ſpeaks to Chriſtians by this Church.</hi> Euery part of the Propoſition proues it ſelf. Firſt à Mark is more clear and ſenſible than the thing marked by it, For, who euer had ſeen our Bleſſed Sauiour walking here on earth, and obſerued his holy life, whoeuer had heard his ſacred words, and ſeen his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles would haue ſaid, his Sanctity, words, and Miracles, were more clear and euident to all, than his Doctrin was of <hi>being God and man.</hi> Therefore the firſt Chriſtians belieued that great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery induced by euident works, and wonders. 2. Theſe Marks are peculiar and proper to the true Church only. You haue
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102688:147"/> the reaſon hereof in the other Treatiſe. <hi>Diſc.</hi> 1. C. 8. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>3.<note place="margin">The force of prudent Motiues.</note> Becauſe it is not poſſible, if à true Church be now on earth that God can permit à false Society to equalize it, much less to ſurpass it in the luſtre of ſuch Motiues as forcibly perswade to diſcern between <hi>That,</hi> and all heretical Communities, For were this done, Falshood would be made as credible to reaſon, as truth, And God would be guilty of Arguing less efficaciouſly in behalf of his own Church, againſt Iewes, Gentils, and obſtinate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Obſerue well the Strength of this Argument. I ſay in à word. If an Arian could truly Aſſert: I haue as many forceable Motiues, And marks of truth belonging to my followers and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, As the now ſuppoſed true Church of Chriſt can shew for it ſelf, could he ſay with truth I will euidence the like Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the like Perpetuity, the like lawful Miſſion of my Paſtors, the like vnity in Faith, the like conuerſions of Heathens, wrought in and by my Church, The like ſucceſſion of Bishops prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching my Doctrin from Chriſts time to this day, The like ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, the like miracles, as any Church on earth can demonſtrate:<note place="margin">They diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the true Church from falſe Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> 
                  <hi>Could an Arian,</hi> I ſay, (or Iew either) ſpeak all this with truth, no Orthodox Chriſtian could argue the one or other of Falshood in Doctrin: For grant thus much, Theſe very men might much better handle and interpret Scripture than Proteſtants do, vtterly deſtitute of all ſuch Marks. The Iew, if the falſe ſuppoſition ſtand would draw the old Teſtament to his ſenſe, and ſo would the Arian the <hi>new;</hi> And who could reproue them could they shew you à Church bearing theſe ſignes of diuine Authority? Hence, Sectaries that only Gloss Scripture, and neuer had any thing like an euidenced Church which taught the Doctrin they now maintain, and ſo earneſtly Gloss for, are moſt reproueable, And vainly attempt to draw any prudent man to à belief of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties.</p>
               <p n="13">13. By all you ſee how important it is to haue à Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety clearly marked, and diſtinguished from falſe Communities, with euident Signes, and rational Motiues before we recurr to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102688:147"/> Scripture. All faith depends on this greater Euidence laid forth to reaſon, as Shall be demonſtrated towards the end of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I would haue euery one ſeriouſly to reflect on what is now ſaid, and once more to know, That Chriſts Church like à glorious Sun euidenceth Her ſelfe by the Luſtre of ſignal Marks, though her eſſential Doctrin belieued by obſcure Faith, appear's not Euident. Find me then out à Church euer in being ſince Chriſts time, vnited in one Faith, glorious in Miracles and conuerſions of Heathens, wherein Bishops and Paſtors lawfully ſent, haue preached Chriſts Doctrin age after age; Giue me à Church which was neuer cenſured or taxed of Errour by any Society of known Orthodox Chriſtians, <hi>She,</hi> and <hi>She</hi> only, is Chriſt's true Spouſe, All other late riſen Aſſemblies, are Conuenticles of Satan; And theſe Marks do not only diſtinguish Her from all<note place="margin">One only Church Shewes theſe Marks.</note> ſuch Conuenticles, as is now noted, but <hi>Collectiuely</hi> taken conuince this Truth, That God ſpeak's to Chriſtians by this Oracle, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof you haue more in the following Chapters.</p>
               <p n="15">15. In the Interim we muſt enter vpon à further difficulty and next enquire, which among ſo many Congregations as now are and haue been in the world, is the only manifeſted true Spouſe of Chriſt? For all, as I ſaid aboue, make not one Church vnless Chriſt hath compoſed this myſtical Body of ſuch members as rightly <hi>belieue,</hi> and of others that iniuriouſly <hi>oppoſe</hi> his ſacred Doctrin. Now becauſe the chief controuerſy is between the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant and Catholick, The firſt pretend's to à Church which teaches Chriſts Doctrin; The Catholick vtterly denies the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and pleads for his <hi>Own</hi> Oracle euidenced by prudent Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. This I ſay being the Conteſt, we are in the firſt place, to vnchurch the Proteſtant, and then proue by vndeniable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where and with whom the true Church of Chriſt is.</p>

Will they dare to ſay That their Church, as it deliuers Proteſtants Doctrin, or, as it is now reformed in England, was euer ſince Chriſt time In Being, and viſible to the world? Can they produce à Succeſſion of Bishops, or Paſtors, that taught Proteſtancy Age after Age, without intermiſſion? Can they show what Conuerſions theſe Proteſtant Paſtors wrought vpon Heathens to their faith, fiue or ſix Centuries ſince? Can they produce, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable Miracles, done by ſuch Paſtors? Moſt euidently No. Therefore our later Proteſtants reiect theſe, and the other like Motiues, as ſlight and impertinent, to euidence their Church (which yet ſay they, teaches Chriſts Doctrin) and <hi>Wilily</hi> do ſo, becauſe they haue none of them. Well. To leaue them without excuſe, to ſilence them for euer; Here is an vn anſwerable Dilemma. Either the marks now kinted at are admitted or, reiected. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them owned as clear cogniſances of the true Church, or of Her Orthodox Doctrin, we moſt juſtly urge Proteſtants to proue,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102688:148"/> what I know will neuer be made probable. Viz. To shew That they had à Church three or four Ages ſince inueſted in the ſignes, and marks, now mentioned. On the other ſide, if which is uſual, ſuch marks be ſlighted as unmeet to manifeſt the true Church, it muſt bee granted, They haue no euidenced Church, and Conſequently no true Doctrin with it. Hence I Argue, Who euer belieues, in an uneuidenced Church, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of all Signes and marks of truth, belieues in no true Church; The Proteſtant belieues in ſuch an vneuidenced Church, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he belieues in no Church: But he who belieues in no Church belieues à Doctrin more than improbable, or abſolutely falſe, And this is fancy or worſe than fancy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What anſwer think ye do Sectaries return to this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?<note place="margin">They return no probable Anſwer.</note> A ſtrange one indeed. They tell vs the only Mark of the Church lies not in any external Notes, but appear's in the written word of God, and the Purity of Scripture. So Alſtedius. <hi>Lib. de notis Eccleſia</hi> C. 29. Whitaker <hi>Contro.</hi> 2. 9. 5. C, 17. and Mr Stillingfleet here and there, ſeem's well pleaſed with the fancy. Contra. 1. The Church had her Marks beſore Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was written, what euer ſenſible Signes <hi>Then</hi> diſtinguished that holy Society from all heretical Conuenticles, makes it yet known to the world and Still as clearly point's it out, For, the writing of Scripture nothing at all obſcured, the exteriour luſtre of thoſe Signes, or prudent Motiues. Contra. 2. A Mark which makes an obſcure thing known is euer more clear and ſenſible, than that is which is marked by it. The Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Say Sectaries,<note place="margin">The Church more clearly manifeſted than Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> is obſcure and muſt be firſt known by Diuine Scripture, But this very Diuinity of Scripture, is more obſcure than the Church (For it is not its own Self-euidence, nor known <hi>ex terminis</hi> to be Diuine) Therefore vnleſſ this Diuinity be made manifeſt by an other light, it cannot giue to all the firſt notice of the Church, which appeares More clearly to ſenſe and reaſon, by its own Signes, than Scripture doth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence it followes. 1. That, Scripture, which should firſt mark out the Church, cannot do it; being more obfcure
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:102688:149"/> than the thing marked by it. It followes. 2. That the Church thus marked, is its own Self-euidence, not Farther demonſtrable to Reaſon. Who euer therefore depriues the Church of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Motiues, or takes from her the glory of Miracles, of Antiquity, Conuerſions, &amp;c. Shall long grope in the dark, before Hee find's either Church, or Scripture, You will ſay. Scripture known by the vniuerſal Tradition of Chriſtians, may well mark out and firſt diſcouer the true Church, Tradition being à thing moſt known, and Senſible to all. Contra. This very Tradition either ſuppoſes à Church ſignalized with other<note place="margin">Of what weight pleading Tradition is</note> rational Motiues, or excludes them; And imports no more but the bare Conſent of Chriſtians, that accept of Scripture as Gods Diuine word. Grant the firſt; we haue all that's wished. Plead only by the Second, or tell à <hi>Heathen</hi> (who may be gained to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the Church) That all Chriſtians vniuerſally own Scripture as Diuine, and mention nothing of Miracles or other Motiues manifest in the Church, He will ſoon reply. The Chineſes haue alſo vniuerſal Tradition or à general conſent of à People largely diffuſed for their Bible; The Turks haue it for their Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, yet ſuch à Tradition alone is no Mark of God's word or the true Church. Why then should it be à mark to Chriſtians, if no more be ſaid?</p>
               <p n="5">5. And the Heathen eaſily makes his Plea good by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing Reaſon <hi>à Priori.</hi> Before this vniuerſal Tradition was, before you ſo many Chriſtians agreed in the Belief of your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Doctrin Thereof was made credible vpon other Motiues, Theſe Motiues are not now extinguished, or of leſſer account becauſe you haue agreed on the Scriptures Diuinity; Nay they<note place="margin">The Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s exceptions againſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only.</note> muſt be preſuppoſed to haue been before you agreed, <hi>For this Agreement is not the cauſe of the Bibles credibility, but an effect of the ſame.</hi> That is. <hi>Therefore ſo many. Christians haue agreed by à vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal Conſent, that Scripture is Gods word, becauſe it was made credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Reaſon Antecedently,</hi> to an Agreement ſo vniuerſal, But the ground of this Agreement was no other but the Authority of the Orthodox Church gloriouſly euidenced, by the Luſtre of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102688:149"/> her Signes and Motiues &amp;c. This Principle alone, vtterly ruins Mr: Stillingfleets Reſolution of Faith, as shall be made clear in an other place.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again ſaith the Heathen, you Proteſtants diſcours not probably, you iuſt proceed as one doth who laies Colours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore à blind man and bid's him iudge of them. You ſay, that both I and Iewes are blind, and cannot diſcouer the light which lies in the Scriptures Diuinity. If this be ſo, how can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that I may find out the true Church by the light of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (though admitted vpon Tradition) which I can no more look on than an owle on the Sun, at Noon-day? Neither will it help you at all, if you Say. Scripture interpreted both Mark's, and manifeſt's the true Church, For I muſt firſt know that Scripture is Diuine, before I giue credit to any Interpreter, And though I were aſcertained of that Diuinity, yet I am ſtill to ſeek whether your Interpretation, or the Arians be better, and this I cannot know without à ſure Rule extrinſick to Scripture, And all fallible Interpretation. Yet the Heathen hath not done, but pinches the Proteſtant shrewdly. Admit, ſaith he, that Scripture Mark's out the Church, and giues vs the firſt Euidence of it, when it tells vs. <hi>The Church is à Citty built vpon à Mountain,</hi> and <hi>founded on à Rock, That all Nations shall flock to it.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt will be with it to the end of the world;</hi> That it euer <hi>had, and will haue Paſtors, Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He clearly conuinces Sectaries.</note> 
                  <hi>and audible, till we all meet in one Vnity of Faith. That it is the Pillar, and ground of Truth</hi> &amp;c. Can you, my good Proteſtants, show me ſuch à Church belonging to you three or four Ages ſince when, you had not one ſingle man in the world profeſſing your Proteſtant Religion? Where was then your Proteſtant Citty viſible on à Mountain? What Rock ſtood it on in thoſe daies, when it was not in being? What Nations, what Iewes what Gentils did it then conuert to your Nouelties? How was Chriſt then with it, and taught it all Truth, when there was no ſuch Church to learn his Doctrin? Giue me à Catologue, of your Viſible Paſtors at that time, or tell me how your Church was then <hi>à Pillar, an Oracle of truth,</hi> whilst all it teaches now is falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and may be falſe?</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:102688:150"/> 7. Hence I argue. What Scripture ſaith is true; Scripture here ſpeaks of à Church founded by Christ, of an <hi>Ancient, Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from what is now ſaid.</note> 
                  <hi>Society, of Her</hi> perpetual Pastors without interruption, of à Church conuerting Nations &amp;c. Therefore it ſpeak's Truth, and points at à ſure Oracle marked with the notes we plead for, who euer then admit's Scripture, must ioyntly own theſe Marks and Signatures of the true Church, But yee Sectaries admit Scripture and haue no ſuch Marked Church, with Antiquity, continuance of Paſtors &amp;c. Ergo you are not members of the true Church, which muſt neceſſarily be found in ſome other Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Here by the way, we muſt preuent à triuial Obiection; For ſome less knowing Aduerſary may reply. Wee deſtroy our own Ground, and now proue the Marks of the Church by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, whereas we ſuppoſe the Scripture firſt proued to be of Diuine Inſpiration, becauſe the Church manifeſted by her Marks and Motiues ſaith ſo.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I Anſwer we proue the Marks of the Church, and the Form of her eſſential Doctrin alſo by Scripture, But how? Vpon à Suppoſition, that the Book be firſt proued Diuine by Church Authority, Thus much done, it is an excellent Principle, But not <hi>Primum indemonſtrabile, its own Self-Euidence,</hi> Or firſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable Principle. This Truth is clear, For no man goes about to conuert à Iew by alleging Paſſages out of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to draw à Heathen to Christianity by any thing writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten either in the old, or new Scripture. As therefore that<note place="margin">Scripture not the firſt in demonſtrable Principle.</note> man would not be well in his wits, who hopes to conuert à Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, by meerly alleging the Definitions of the Council of Trent which he ſlights, ſo he would be as ſenſles, did he hope to conuert à Heathen by Scripture only, as much vnderualued by him, as the preſent Definitions of the Church are by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. Hence you ſee how Scripture is à Principle against Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, who admit it, and reiect an infallible Church. By Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we Argue and conuince them of errour, might the words Thereof bear their proper ſenſe without fancied Gloſſes, Yet if
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102688:150"/> we make à right <hi>Analyſis</hi> it is not the firſt indemonſtrable Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but, <hi>Per Modum ſuppoſitionis</hi> only, that is, it muſt be either ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or proued Diuine.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I ſay yet more. Though both the Iew, and Heathen, owned Scripture as it truly is, à Book indited by the Holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Though it were ſo there yet remains à difficulty not to bee ſolued.</note> yet they haue but made one ſtep, as it were, towards Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, For when ſuch men look well about them, and find Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture differently ſenſed by ſo many iarring Heads as haue it in their hands, by <hi>Arians, Socinians, Quakers, Proteſtants,</hi> &amp;c. (Catholicks diſſent from them all) where can, I beſeech you, theſe half Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whether <hi>Iewes,</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> ſecurely reſt? With whom can they rationally vnite Themſelues? whoſe ſenſe muſt they belieue and own as the vndoubted meaning of the Holy Ghoſt? To doe any thing prudently in ſo weighty à Matter is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Vnless they firſt come to the knowledge of Chriſts true Church, which as well Aſcertain's them of the Scriptures ſenſe in all Controuerted points of Faith, as it doth, of the Book's Diuinity. Now further. It is not poſſible to know the true ſenſe of Scripture but by the Church; it is not poſſible to know the Church, but by her Marks, (the eſſential Doctrin Thereof no more mark's it ſelf as true, than Scripture Doctrin denotes its own Diuinity) The Sectary therefore that rob's the Church of her Marks and the <hi>external Glory</hi> of <hi>Miracles, Conuerſions, Perpetuity</hi> &amp;c. is guilty of three hainous crimes at once.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Firſt he makes the Conuerſion of à Iew to Chriſtianity<note place="margin">Sectaries make the Conuerſion of Iewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> impoſſible.</note> moſt impoſſible. I'le show you how. The Iew Admit's of the old Teſtament and drawes from euery paſſage which ſpeak's of Chriſt and the Church, à Senſe quite different from that which Chriſtians own. The Proteſtant admit's both the Old and New Scripture, And as we may Suppoſe, is at à hot diſpute with à Iew concerning Chriſtian Religion. First ſaith the Iew, Lay, Sir, your New Testament aſide, which is no Principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with me, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it neither euidences it Self immediatly to be Gods word, nor can you proue it Diuine vpon any ſure ground extrinſecal to the Book. Therefore we must Argue by à Principle common
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102688:151"/> to vs both, <hi>The old Teſtament only.</hi> You read There, I read alſo, You know the Original language, ſo do I, You compare Text with Text, I doe the like, You Gloſs, and I Gloſs againſt you, Yet after all is done, you draw one ſenſe out of this very Scripture, and would proue Chriſt to be the true Meſſias, I draw from thence an other quite Contrary, And ſay He is not. My demand is, whether Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proued.</note> whom you Adore, hath prouided men of better means (Than your Gloſſes and mine are) whereby we may certainly know what the ſenſe of this Scripture is? If he haue done ſo, it can be nothing but à Church manifeſted by Supernatural Signes and miracles, (for God now teaches none by Angels or Enthuſiaſms) if the guidance of à Church be wanting we are all left in darkness, And know not what Senſe to make of Scripture; and this ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeems the Goodnes of à Sauiour, who, as you ſay, came to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the world and teach all truth, which is not done, For he leaues Reaſon in Darkness and Teaches not where his true Church is. It may well be the Proteſtant will except againſt his Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Gloſſes, but He is ſoon ſilenced, for Saith the Iew, you, good man, when you treat with Papiſts interpret Scripture as you pleaſe, and why may not I proceed ſo with you, And vſe the like liberty?</p>
               <p n="12">12. The ſecond crime committed by the Proteſtant, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priues the Church of Her external Signes, is, that he Eclipſes that great light of the world (which as Origen ſaith shines to all) And make it as Obſcure, as ſome Proteſtants make their Church inuiſible before Luther. What I ſay is certain, For no man can find the Church by reaſon, when all rational Motiues are<note place="margin">What Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of.</note> taken from it, And held impertinent to illuſtrate that great moral Body. Hence you ſee the third ſin of Sectaries relating to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This Book alſo loſeth all credit with Chriſtians, becauſe it Euidenceth not its own Diuinity, nor can any Signaliſed Church tell vs, it is Diuine, or certainly declare the true ſenſe thereof, to either learned or vnlearned.</p>
               <p n="13">13. My laſt argument againſt the Proteſtant is no Topick, nor bare Probability, but à plain Demonſtration. The Title ſaith;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102688:151"/> This reformed man has no Chriſtian Doctrin made credible to<note place="margin">The laſt conuincing Argument.</note> Reaſon, whilſt he <hi>belieues as Proteſtant.</hi> To proue the Aſſertion, Three Principles are here Suppoſed. Firſt, that the Markes of the Proteſtant Church or of its Doctrin lie (as theſe men will haue it) in the Purity of Scripture only. 2. That their Church Doctrin is either contained in the 39. <hi>Articles,</hi> or implies ſo much as all called Chriſtians Belieue, and no more, Though plain He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks in many particular Tenets. 3. That this Proteſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity as it Teaches, is either the whole Church of Chriſt exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding other Societies, or only à Part of the vniuerſal Church. Theſe Principles Suppoſed, you haue my Demonſtration.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Scripture Marks the true Doctrin of Chriſts Church, but it neither mentioneth nor marks out the Doctrin contained in the 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> for our newer men call theſe inferiour Truths <hi>only,</hi> And hold them not Regiſtred in God's word. Neither doth it Aſſert ſo much as darkly, that à Mixture of Truth, and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, (ſuch as all Hereticks haue owned and do own) is the Doctrin of the true Catholick Church; Leaſt of all, That à Doctrin common to Arians, Proteſtants, and Catholicks, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient<note place="margin">Scripture diſowns. Proteſtancy.</note> to Saluation. Laſtly, it ſaith no where, that the Proteſtant Church containing that reformed Doctrin, is by it Self the whole true Church of Chriſt excluding all other Societies, nor ſo much as à Part of it, And this I proue.</p>
               <p n="15">15 If as reformed, it be à Part of the true Catholick Church, the Profeſſors of it haue now, and had before Luther ſome Partners who ioyn'd with them in the belief of their reformed Doctrin, But before Luther, they had not one ſole man in the world that belieued as they belieue, and ſo wanted fellowship, becauſe, neither they, nor their Partners were at all in Being: Now at this inſtant, they haue no Society of men, called à Church, (run ouer all the world) which ſide's with them, or hold's either the. 39. <hi>Articles,</hi> or à Doctrin common to all Chriſtians, to be the true Doctrin of Chriſt, or of his vniuerſal Church. All this I ſay is euident. And.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Hence you ſee, in what plight theſe men are, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:102688:152"/> to à Church marked and made euident by Scripture, and<note place="margin">A clear inference againſt Sectaries.</note> when they haue that ſacred Book in their hands, it is impoſſible to find ſo much as one Sentence or ſyllable in behalfe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy. Thoſe other exteriour Signes of Conuerſions, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Antiquity &amp;c. are of no Account with them, And were they otherwiſe, moſt euidently they belong not to the reformed Doctrin of the English Church. Here is à piece of ſad ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes for Sectaries, who haue à Church neither Spoken of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor manifeſted to Reaſon by one Supernatural wonder. So vneuidenced à Thing it is, And Conſequently vpon à double Account, no Church at all.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Sectary may reply. When he Aſſerts Scripture Marks the true Church or Her Doctrin, the meaning is not that it ſpeak's expreſly the Tenets of Proteſtants, but only Saies, it is à ſufficient <hi>Repoſitory</hi> of all things neceſſary to Saluation, and deliuers ſo much plainly. What euer therefore is not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught in ſcripture ceaſeth to be neceſſary. Contra. 1. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants<note place="margin">A Reply Anſwered.</note> granting thus much, may ſeek long before they find Their particular Tenets, becauſe Scripture deliuers none of them either expreſly, or by any clear Deduction. Contra. 2. The Iew and Heathen regard not the plaineſt Truths in Holy Writ before the book be proued Diuine, The moſt plain Verities auaile nothing with them, Yet God hath afforded means to draw them to Chriſtianity. But it ſeem's our Sectaries in all their talk of the Scriptures clarity, neuer reflect on theſe Strangers from Chriſt, nor point at the means whereby their Conuerſion may bee wrought. Contra. 3. The Arian and the Orthodox as highly differ about the ſenſe of plain Scripture, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant and Catholick, about the ſenſe of Chriſts own words. <hi>This is my body,</hi> And theſe differences, either touch on fundamental Matters, or there are none ſuch in the whole Bible.

               <p n="2">2. I ſay firſt, before we come to more conuincing Arguments. Antiquity is à certain Note of Chriſt Church. The reaſon is. As God was before the Diuel, and Truth before falshood, So the Orthodox Church, whether you take it from Adam, or<note place="margin">Antiquity denotes the true Church</note> from the firſt preaching of Chriſtian Doctrin, was before all Sects and Hereſies. The Roman Catholick Church only which Chriſt founded, and is ſo much extolled by the Apoſtle, has this Precedency. It was, when the Arians were not, we know their firſt Riſe, it was when the Pelagians were not, we know their Beginning, it was when rhe Donatiſts were not, their Origen is as well known, as that of Proteſtants, which firſt pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out with one unfortunate Luther, ſomething aboue an age ſince.

               <p n="4">4. Hence I argue. But the Roman Catholick Church only, hath euer continued in being without interruption and neuer<note place="margin">The proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vrged.</note> changed, or Altered the Doctrin which She firſt learned of Chriſt; Proteſtancy which began one only Age ſince, moſt euidently wants this continuance, and euery year put's on à new counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Therefore the Roman Catholick Church, and not that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:102688:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Proteſtants, is the Spouſe of Chriſt. That the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church ſtood permanently in being euer ſince Chriſt, is as demonſtrable, as that Proteſtants were not before Luther. The Viſible perpetual Succeſſion of our Popes, of our Bishops, of our Paſtors and of our Catholick People in all ages, is an irrefragable Proof. Neither do Sectaries much cauil at this Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Succeſſion, or the exteriour Permanency of our Church (for<note place="margin">What Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries obiect.</note> that's euident) But here is their Plea. This Church (ſay they) once Orthodox changed from her ſelfe, forged new Articles of faith, Contrary to the primitiue Doctrin, Herein lies the great Charge. Now if I demonſtrate, that the Roman Catholick Church once confeſſedly Orthodox, hath euer ſince been Viſible in the world, and neuer ſwerued from the pure Primitiue Doctrin in after Ages, She is certainly the Church of Chriſt ſtill without Alteration. You will Ask how can this be euinced?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some may think 'tis beſt done by Paralleling our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent known Church Doctrin with that of the Primitiue Times. Very good. But by what means shall we come to à right Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel? One may Say. Make A diligent Inſpection into the Records, and Writings of thoſe worthy Fathers, who liued in the firſt Ages, And all is done. I Anſwer. This Rule preciſely conſidered help's nothing. For what if thoſe Fathers neuer medled with moſt of the Controuerſies, now agitated between vs and Sectaries? And t'is no wonder at all if they did not, For may not à new Sort of Hereticks riſe vp to morrow, whoſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours neuer entred into the thoughts either of the Fathers, or of any man now liuing? Again, What if moſt of thoſe ancient Writings be loſt, (many certainly are) we are at à Stand. But finally, what if doubts ariſe concerning the ſenſe of thoſe few preſerued copies yet extant? can Sectaries Gloſſes or ours either determin what's right Orthodox Doctrin by them? No. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore<note place="margin">By what means one may come to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Doctrin?</note> as I ſaid aboue, no man can come to à full, exact, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory knowledge, of the Primitiue Truths, but by the voice and Tradition of the preſent Church. Reiect this voice of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church, we are caſt into darkness, we may diſpute long but
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:102688:155"/> end nothing. Now becauſe it lies not in my way to Treat of that excellent Rule of Tradition, learnedly handled by others, I'le giue you three Conuincing reaſons, And proue my Aſſertion. viz. <hi>That the Roman vniuerſal Church, once Orthodox<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neuer changed the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Doctrin.</hi> To show this, Two certain Principles are to be reflected on.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Firſt. God had alwaies an Orthodox Church on earth founded by Chriſt, which was, and is pure without mixture (at leaſt) of notorious damnable Errours, and which neuer taught<note place="margin">An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Roman Catholick Church ſtil pure in Doctrin.</note> Chriſtians any shameful, false Doctrin; for had it done ſo in any Age, it had then ceaſed <hi>Eo ipſo</hi> to be Chriſt's pure Church. The 2. Principle. Proteſtants confess, (and t'is à certain truth) that the Roman Catholick Church continued Orthodox without No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table errour, for the firſt three or four Centuries.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hence I argue. If this Church once pure, abandoned Chriſt's Doctrin in after Ages, or forged new Articles of faith contrary to the Primitiue verities, that <hi>Change was Notorious,</hi> shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and damnable, as we shall ſee preſently. But it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that She euer made ſuch à shameful, Notorious change, And here is my Reaſon: Had She done ſo, Chriſt in that Age when this ſuppoſed Alteration began, would haue had no Orthodox Church on earth free from gross and culpable Errour, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his own pure Church would wholly haue been abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</p>
               <p n="8">8. You will Ask how I proue this? I Anſwer moſt euidently. Begin if you pleaſe from the third Age, when the Roman Church was pure, And deſcend to Luthers dayes, you will find all the known Societies of men called Chriſtians, to haue been either Orthodox Belieuers, Or groſly erring in Faith, yea plain condemned Hereticks, And ſo reckoned of by Proteſtants. Such were the <hi>Arians, Neſtorians, Pelagians, Monothelits, Donatiſts</hi> &amp;c. And all others nameable, excepting Roman Catholicks. But <hi>thoſe</hi> gross erring men, euidently taught not Chriſts pure<note place="margin">One reaſon vrged.</note> Doctrin without notable Errour, much less conſtituted either à Part, or the whole Orthodox Church, which Chriſt eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:102688:155"/> in truth, Therefore if the Roman Catholick Church went to wrack alſo, if She erred <hi>notoriouſly</hi> with theſe known erring Societies, the Orthodoxiſm and Purity of <hi>the whole Church</hi> ceaſed to be in the world. And this is impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Here in à word is all I would ſay. Chriſt had euer à Church Entierly pure on earth, for he founded one pure, which should alwaies continue in that integrity laid in Her very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; But no errour was laid in the foundations of the Roman Catholick Church once Confeſſedly pure, therefore no noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Errour ſtained it in after Ages; Or, if any ſuch errour fouled that once fair Spouſe of Chriſt, this Sequele is euident: <hi>There was</hi> at <hi>that time no pure Church in Being,</hi> vnless our Nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts pleaſe (and perhaps they may do ſo in time) to make <hi>Arians, Donatiſts,</hi> and ſuch à rabble of men, more Orthodox Chriſtians than their own Progenitors were, and all the Roman Catholicks are now, the whole world ouer.</p>
               <p n="10">10. You ſee I inſiſt vpon <hi>notorious Errours,</hi> And do ſo on ſet<note place="margin">Why wee inſiſt vpon Notorious errours.</note> purpoſe to preuent à Reply of ſome newer Sectaries, who ſay the Church of Rome hath indeed Her Errours, But not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or deſtructiue of Saluation. And will you know the reaſon of this trifling? Here it is. If they ſay She was not Orthodox in fundamentals, there was no true Church in being for à thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years before Luther, and this no Chriſtian dare Aſſert, And if they make her Orthodox in euery Article She taught, both Hereſy and Schiſm fall's shamefully vpon Proteſtants, Who dare not grant they abandonned à Church Entierly pure and blamless, when they left it. Hence à middle way was wiſely (or rather moſt ſimply) thought of: Our Church, forſooth, muſt be what Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants pleaſe, partly true. viz. in à few Fundamentals, and partly falſe in other Matters of less concern, which theſe men, elected by God, were to reform, and tell exactly what was amiss, or how far it hath erred, &amp;c. And therefore name themſelues the <hi>Reformed Church.</hi> Well. Let this whimſy pass, largely refuted in the other Treatiſe, and in paſſing take notice of à pitifull Church indeed which Chriſt had by theſe mens own Confeſſion
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:102688:156"/> ten whole ages before Luther. It was à meer deformed Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter made vp of Linzy wolzy ſtuff, of tawny Colours, of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and nothing, in à word <hi>of Truth and Falshood.</hi> But here is not all.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I am to proue much more, if Proteſtants Principles ſtand firm. viz. That neither we nor they, had any Orthodox Church, in fundamentals before Luther, and Conſequently no true Church was in being for ten whole Ages. Now moſt euidently, Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had nothing like à Church, for they were not in the world, And it is as euident, if their Charge hold good againſt our Church, it had bin much better neuer to haue appeared than to ſee it turned into ſo many vgly shapes, into ſuch an vnfashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Monſter as theſe new men make it. In à word this ancient Catholick Society, if Sectaries ſay right (and Mark euer the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) <hi>erred notoriouſlly in the very fundamentals of Faith, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Faith totally ruined in Sectaries, Principles.</note> 
                  <hi>neither belieued in Chriſt, nor Creed,</hi> and therefore there was no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church before Luther, <hi>nor yet is, to this day.</hi> If I euidence not this vpon the ſuppoſition now made, neuer Credit me here after. To doe it, pleaſe to obſerue that by à fundamental Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in Faith, I vnderſtand à Doctrin, which if falſly taught, contrary to Chriſts verities, is as damnable to thoſe who teach it, as the Arians errours are at this day damnable to Arians. Hence I Argue.</p>
               <p n="12">12. What euer Society of men forges new Articles of Faith contrary to the Primitiue Doctrin, or tell's the world à loud lye, that God reuealed ſuch things as he neuer reuealed, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly<note place="margin">The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly proued.</note> disowns and yet execrat's, And more ouer obliges all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, after à ſufficient propoſal, to belieue ſuch falſities vpon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Reuelation, and this vnder pain of damnation, doth open iniury to Gods Infinite verity, Aſſert's that which Eternal Truth neuer taught And therefore ſins damnably, or err's in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Faith. But Proteſtants, ſay, the Roman Catholick Church long before Luther did ſo, ergo She ſinned damnably and erred in the very fundamentals of Faith. That She did ſo is euident vpon their own charge, For this Church taught <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

It maintain's Purgatory, Praying to Saints &amp;c. Chriſt neuer deliuered ſuch Doctrins, nor the Primitiue Church belieued ſo. Now further. Theſe are all loud Lies if Sectaries ſpeak Truth, and our Church obliges all Chriſtians to belieue them as truths reuealed by an infinite Verity vnder pain of damnation, which yet, as they ſuppoſe were not reuealed. Therefore She firſt openly iniures Gods Veracity, which can be no light Offence, but mortal and damnable, And conſequently err's in the very fundamentals of Faith, Therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

And here briefly is the vltimate reaſon of all that's Said. The enormous Sin of all Hereticks paſt and preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this only, that they pertinaciouſly charge, or faſten vpon God à Doctrin Hee neuer taught, this alone makes them Hereticks, but the Church of Rome, ſay Sectaries, hath don ſo, ergo She was, and is yet Heretical.</p>
               <p n="13">13. If this Argument which I hold demonſtratiue conuince not, I will propoſe an other and then briefly ſolue one or too Obiections. The Arians who deny à Trinity of Diuine Perſons, are guilty of à fundamental Errour. All grant it. <hi>Ergo</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church was, and is as guilty, or rather more guilty if Proteſtants doe not Calumniate. I proue it. The Arians errour related to à ſublime and ſpeculatiue Myſtery which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend's all humane Capacity, But one ſuppoſed Errour of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church (as Sectaries tell the Story) is worſe and more gross, to wit, à plain, palpable and practical <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Why? She Adores à piece of bread for God, wherefore if <hi>Idolatry</hi> was euer in the world, She commit's that grieuous Sin And errs damnably,<note place="margin">An other Argument Vrged.</note> But no Sin can be greater, no Errour is more deſtructiue of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, than Idolatry; If then our Church be guilty of that crime, She is far enough from being fundamentally Orthodox. Here is the Argument.</p>
               <p n="14">14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One may Anſwer, it is only the Sectaries Opinion (which
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:102688:157"/> is fallible and may be falſe) that we are Idolaters. What then? You Nouelliſts hold the opinion, you print it, you publish it, and perſwade Thouſands, and Thouſands poor beguiled ſouls, we are Idolaters, and they Iudge ſo of vs, And as long as that Iudgement ſtand's immoueable, they cannot own vs Orthodox Chriſtians in Fundamentals. But let vs come more cloſely to the point, and ſpeak of rhe thing in it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Here is à Dilemma. We are Idolaters, or not; Grant the firſt; We err in the fundamentals of Faith, and were no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church either before or after Luther. Contrarywiſe, if we be not Idolaters but only Adore the Sauiour of the world, really and ſubſtantially preſent, vnder the Forms of bread and wine, Ye Gentleman, do not only hideoufly calumniate à whole An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, And ſin damnably; But more ouer Err in à funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point of Faith, For, if the Second part of the Dilemma ſubſiſt's. viz. That we Adore not à piece of bread, but that very Chriſt ſubſtantially preſent (vnder the Species of bread) who dyed on à Cross, The whole errour, the whole Sin, you charge on vs, fall's heauily on your Selues. You firſt tell the world à plain lie and ſay God neuer reuealed Chriſt's real Preſence, in à conſecrated Hoſt as the Catholick Church belieues, whereas vpon the Suppoſition now made, He has reuealed it; Therefore you contradict God, you iniure an infinite Verity, which is à<note place="margin">Errour and ſin, fall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily on Sectaries.</note> hideous fundamental errour. Of ſuch conſequence it is to Tax<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> à whole Ancient Church of falſe Doctrin, That to ſay ſo, is à flat Hereſy, and the Calumny without repentance is damnable.</p>
               <p n="16">16. 2. You oblige all you teach, and this vnder pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not to fall down or Adore Chriſt, ſubſtantially preſent in the Sacrament, yet vpon the ſuppoſition (which is euer to be minded) he is really there and claims the higheſt honour the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeſt worship, as moſt due to his ſacred Perſon. This you ſcornfully deny, and both err and ſin damnably. One may Anſwer you adore Chriſt in Heauen, and that's enough. Contra. He merits Adoration whereuer he is preſent, for if he should viſibly appear to any of you all, you would (if Chriſtians) fall down
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102688:157"/> and Adore him: Here he is in the Sacrament vpon the Suppoſition, and you diſdainfully deny him homage and veneration.

                  <p>A ſecond Reaſon showing, That if the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church erred but in one Article of Faith, there is now no Fundamental Faith in the woild. VVere Errour in this Church it is à re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediless Euil and cannot bee amended by any, leaſt of all by Proteſtants</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. SOme as was ſaid aboue may obiect. The Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church before Luther was right in à few funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals for She belieued in God, in Chriſt, owned à Trinity &amp;c. So far, and à little further perchance She may be reputed Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, yet erred in other Matters which Sectaries deſire to amend, and ſo to ſettle Chriſtian Doctrin again on it's old foundations. Obſerue how I muſt labour to make that an Heretical Society vpon our Sectaries Suppoſition, which was and is the only true Church in the world; And therefore ſay. If our Church hath erred but in one only Matter of Chriſtian belief, She is Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, diſloyal to Chriſt, and can be belieued in nothing. To proue<note place="margin">The Church is traiterous if falſe in one Article.</note> the Aſſertion, Suppoſe an Embaſſadour ſent to à forraign ſtate with this deep Charge, that he vtter nothing in his Princes name but ſo much only as he is commiſſioned to ſpeak. Suppoſe again, the man declares ſome few truths to the ſtate as his Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, But withall forges twenty other vntruths on his own head, and ſtifly affirm's his order is to deliuer all he ſaith in his Maſters name. Would not ſuch à man think ye be à Traitour vpon à double account? Firſt becauſe he exceed's the bounds of his Commiſſion and deliuers that he had no order for, But chiefly becauſe he ſpeaks vaſt falſities, wholly Contrary to his iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement who ſent him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:102688:158"/>2. The Application in eaſy. The firſt Teachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel were legates ſent from God to à great State; the whole world, For <hi>in omnem terram ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uit ſonus eorum.</hi> They taught euery where and well for ſome short time our Chriſtian Verities, as the Prince who ſent them Commanded, But their Succeſſors, the Paſtors and Doctors of the Roman Catholick Church in after Ages, had, Say Sectaries, the ill luck to miſcarry, to turn Traitours, for, beſides à few fundamental Truths vpheld no man knowes how, They did not only exceed their commiſſion in deliuering Doctrin to all Nations which Chriſt their Maſter neuer allowed of, but more ouer; forged of their own heads twenty vntruths. <hi>Purgatory, Praying to Saints, Tranſubſlantiation</hi> &amp;c. And ſpake all in their Princes name, Said alſo they had Commiſſion from Chriſt to teach ſo. This fact, if the Charge be true, is Treaſonable, they iniured Chriſt<note place="margin">And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not Orthodox.</note> and his Verities and betrayed their truſt; But à Church ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious cannot be Orthodox. Therefore if Sectaries do not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate, Chriſt had no Orthodox Church in the world before Luther which I intended to proue, and Conſequently Proteſtants are yet no true Church at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſay moreouer. If the Roman Catholick Church hath taught falſe Doctrin but in one onely Matter of Chriſtian belief, She can be belieued in nothing, yea I may rationally ſuſpect her falſe in all She teaches. Iuſt ſo it is. If the book of Scripture deliuer's one Doctrin falſe which Chriſtians now belieue, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not credit it in any thing. The reaſon is: One and the ſame Motiue of my belief duely and equally applied, euer moues to an equal Aſſent, or to None at all. For example. I belieue Chriſt dyed for vs, becauſe Gods word ſaies ſo, Here is the Motiue of my Aſſent: I belieue alſo that he aſcended into Heauen, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the ſame word of God ſpeaks it, here is the ſame Motiue. Imagin now by à ſuppoſed impoſſibility, that this latter Article<note place="margin">A Church falſe in one Article merits no beliefe.</note> is Gods word, <hi>but falſe;</hi> I cannot belieue our Sauiours Death vpon the Motiue of God's word, For if this word be falſe and once deceiue, it may as eaſily be falſe and deceiue me twice, And there is no poſſible means to quit me of my errour, Becauſe whoeuer
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:102688:159"/> endeauours to do that, is of less Authority than God's word, which is now ſuppoſed to deceiue me. If therefore the Firſt Verity can reueal an vntruth, none can belieue either man or Angel ſpeaking of the high Myſteries of our Faith, and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently All muſt ſtill remain in Errour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Apply this Diſcourſe to the Roman Catholick Church which pretend's at leaſt (I ſay no more yet) to be Gods Oracle, and to ſpeak in His name. She ſpeaking in his name aſſures me, that Infants are to be Baptized, I belieue Her vpon her word: She alſo tells me, there is à Purgatory, but we muſt now ſuppoſe with Sectaries, it is à great vntruth, if ſo; I cannot poſſibly belieue Her in the other Doctrin of <hi>Infant Baptiſm.</hi> For if she deceiues me once She may well do it again, and which is to be noted, There is no means left vnder Heauen to vnbeguile me or to draw me out of my ſuppoſed Errour; for who euer attempts to do that, is of less Authority than my Church, which is ſuppoſed to teach, to err in Her teaching, and ſtifly to maintain the Errour. Scripture cannot help here, vnless it be clear vpon an indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principle, that the ſenſe of it, and Doctrin of my Church can differ in points of Faith, which muſt be <hi>proued,</hi> and not <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</hi> If Fathers be alleaged Seemingly contrary to this known Doctrin, my duty is to explicate them, and rather to draw the Fathers to what the Church teaches than to renounce Her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and adhere to the dubious and yet vnknown Senſe of any Father.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now here is à short conſideration For Sectaries. I ſaid, whoeuer ſuppoſeth the Roman Catholick Church to haue erred,<note place="margin">A Reflection for Sectaries.</note> muſt ioyntly own it ſo remediless an Euil, that all the men on earth cannot help or remoue the ſuppoſed errour from this Church. The reaſon is. All the Proofs and Principles (ſetting plain Scripture aſide whereof there is no danger) which may be thought pertinent to impeach Her of errour, will fall infinitly short and proue less ponderous, less ſubſtantial to perſwade that She has erred, than her ſole Vote, and own Authority (whilſt she anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizes the falshood) is to perſwade the contrary. Viz. <hi>That
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102688:159"/> She neuer erred.</hi> Hence Sectaries, confeſſedly fallible men, who<note place="margin">Sectaries Attempt deſperate and why?</note> may eaſily ſpoil all they goe about to mend, aduenture deſperatly to reform the Church, when the very Principles they should reform by (were there any ſuch in being) are incomparably of less weight, ſtrength and force than the Authority of this Church is, which ſaith She cannot erre. Howeuer She muſt be reformed (and here is the wonder) before they know whether She has erred, or haue the leaſt aſſurance of their own half accomplish't reformation. Who then ſee's not, euery attempt made againſt our Church this way to bee, as really it is, à folly, an vnaduiced Enterpriſe no less impoſſible, than in the higheſt manner improbable? Mark what à task lies on them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Firſt they are to proue She has erred, which was neuer yet done 2. To giue in Principles whereby they will reform. 3. To<note place="margin">VVhat they are to proue</note> Shew themſelues well ſetled in à perfect Reformation. 4. To euince that all thoſe innumerable learned men of our Church from the Fourth to the preſent Age haue been ſtupidly blind, bereaued of iudgement and beſotted with Errour. 5. Wheras other Chriſtians both more aged and moſt learned eſpyed none of theſe Errours, They are to proue that God made choiſe of ſuch vncommiſſioned men to perform à work ſo long neglected by the Orthodox world. But of theſe particulars enough is ſaid in the other Treatiſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hence two things follow. Firſt, that Sectaries only loſe time, when by alleging à few dark Teſtimonies of the Fathers they offer to ouerthrow any Doctrin of our Church. Alas, what this Oracle poſitiuely defin's is à ſtronger Principle than twenty du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Authorities of Fathers (if any ſuch were) in appearance contrary. It followes. 2. That the Roman Catholick Church muſt of neceſſity be either owned Orthodox in all She teaches, or cannot be belieued in any thing.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Wherefore I ſay à great word. If this Church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the world in teaching à Purgatory, for example; <hi>neither we nor Sectaries can certainly belieue, that Chriſt was here on earth or Redeemed vs.</hi> For Ask, why belieue wee this great Myſtery? If you
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:102688:160"/> Anſwer Scripture reueal's it, you are Queſtioned again. How<note place="margin">One Errour in the Church Deſtroyes all Faith.</note> know you that Scripture is Gods word which <hi>Ex terminis</hi> euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not it ſelf? You muſt Anſwer Vniuerſal Tradition and all the Churches in the world haue owned the Book for Gods word. Very good. But The Church hitherto ſuppoſed moſt Orthodox, among ſo many Heretical Societies, and Her Tradition likewiſe haue actually deceiued all; For She is now Imagined to haue taught the false Doctrins <hi>of Purgatory, Tranſubſtantiation</hi> &amp;c. Therefore you cannot belieue Her, or any Tradition, for erring in one point of Faith, She is not belieuable in any (This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ſtand's firm) Much less can you truſt to the Doctrin or Tradition of known Heretical Churches, whether <hi>Arians, Pelagians</hi> or others, For all theſe haue erred and moſt groſly, Therefore you haue no certainty of the verities contained in Scripture, nor can you belieue this one Prime Article. <hi>Chriſt dyed for vs,</hi> by Diuine Faith.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Let therefore the Sectary labour all that's poſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the fundamentals of Faith into the shorteſt room Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, let him mince them almoſt to nothing, let this one Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. <hi>Ieſus is the Chriſt</hi> be Faith enough for all: I <hi>ſay if the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church ſpeaking in the name of God, as She pretends to ſpeak, hath taught but one falſe Article, and obliged Chriſtians to belieue it vnder pain of damnation,</hi> (Purgatory for example) <hi>none can now vpon any Motiue known to the world firmly belieue That Ieſus is the Chriſt.</hi> So pernicious, is one known errour of the Church, that it ruins's all belief of other Articles, nor can ſuch à Church be more truſted in any thing She ſpeaks, than Scripture relied on, were it falſe in that Article. <hi>Ieſus is the Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The reaſon <hi>à Priori</hi> is. All Faith is at laſt reduced, or finally reſolued into Gods Diuine Reuelation, whether he ſpeaks by this or that Inſtrument, by this or that Oracle, imports nothing.<note place="margin">The Vltima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te reaſon of the Aſſertion.</note> The difference of the Oracle he ſpeaks by, <hi>diuerſifies not faith,</hi> which alwaies tend's to one Center, and reſts on one ſure Ground, Gods <hi>Veracity.</hi> If he ſpeaks by à Prophet that's his Oracle, If by an Apoſtle he is made an Oracle, If by the exteriour words
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:102688:160"/> of Scripture, they are Oracles, if by the Church, She is his Oracle. Now further. Suppoſe any of theſe aſſumed Oracles ſpeaking in the name of God declare à falſe Doctrin to Chriſtians, the Falſity <hi>Vltimatly redound's to God,</hi> who own's them as Oracles, yet by them teaches the world Falſities. It fall's out here; As if à Prince should ſend à Legate to à State who ſpeak's in his name, and cheat the whole State by his Embaſſy: would not all deſeruedly vpon the Suppoſition, more impute the Cheat to the Prince than to the Legate that ſpeaks in his name? The parity is exact and proues, if either Scripture, Prophet, Apoſtle, or Church ſpeaking in the name of God deliuers falſe Doctrin, God himſelf deceiues vs, and therefore <hi>Rich. de S. Vict.</hi> Said well in this ſenſe alſo. <hi>Si error eſt quem credimus</hi> &amp;c. If we belieue an errour, T'is you, Great God who haue deceiued vs, But if God can once deceiue, either <hi>immediatly</hi> By Himſelfe, or <hi>mediatly</hi> by his Oracle, The whole Syſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Chriſtian Faith, is desſtroyed. What I ſay would bee true, Although He should make à ſolemn proteſtation of Speaking Truth, For euen then he cannot oblige me to belieue, becauſe he may deceiue in that very Proteſtation, and deliuer à falſity, if the ſuppoſition hold.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Here then is the final Concluſion. As <hi>ſubiectiue</hi> Faith in à Belieuer is <hi>Indiuiſible, That is,</hi> it <hi>is either wholly good or wolly naught</hi> None can haue à piece of Faith without the whole vertue, (an<note place="margin">Could the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one falſe Article She can bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued in nothing.</note> Arian cannot belieue Chriſt to be à Redeemer, if He denies the Trinity) So if one Matter of Faith propoſed by the Church be really Contrary to what She defines, None can belieue any thing She teaches, For, the meer Poſſibility of deceiuing Chriſtians in one Article, impoſſibilitates the Belief of all She propoſeth. And this proues the Church abſolutly infallible not in ſome points only, but in all and euery Doctrin, whereof you haue more in the, 15 16 and 17 Chapters following.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Some may reply. I ſuppoſe all this while the Church made ſo ſtedfaſtly God's Oracle as not to err in any Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin She propoſes, which is <hi>Petitio Principy</hi> or à begging of the Queſtion. Contra. And Ye Gentlemen whilſt you impeach
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:102688:161"/> Her of Errour Suppoſe Her <hi>Instrumentum diuulſum,</hi> an Oracle tom, as it were, from Gods <hi>Sſpecial Aſsiſtance,</hi> iuſt as if I sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You ſuppoſe Her à fair ſpouſe, yet make Her à harlot, when and as Often as you pleaſe. You acknowledge ſome Church or other (find that out where you can) to teach Truth, yet you like petulant Schollers will forſooth be ſo wiſe, as to tell her where she miſſeth in Her Leſſon and correct Her for it; And you haue done it to the purpoſe, For you haue deſtroied Her Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, rob'd Her Altars, prophaned Her Temples, abuſed Her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, banished ſome, and hang'd vp other.

I ſuppoſe nothing but what is manifeſt, that Chriſt euer had à Church on earth (once more find it where you can) and that God ſpeaks to Chriſtians by this Oracle, which he will be with to the end of the world, And againſt which Hell gates shall neuer preuail. Now I ſay, if this Church which God (not I) makes his own Oracle, and promiſes to teach Truth by it, can deceiue but in one Matter of Faith, <hi>God himſelf deceiues vs,</hi> And this Church ceaſeth <hi>Eo ip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="13">13. You may ſay. 2. The whole ground of this Diſcourſe à Fallacy and comes only to thus much. If à man once tell à lie he muſt be thought à lyar in all he ſpeaks. So it is. The Church ſpeaks an vntruth in ſome things, <hi>Ergo</hi> it doth ſo, or may do ſo in all, ſeemes no good conſequence. <hi>Contra.</hi> If an Embaſſadour once be found in an Vntruth when he ſpeaks in his Princes name, I think few Monarchs or States will no more belieue him in like occaſions, Than giue credit to one conuicted<note place="margin">The diſpari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty betwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The diſparity between à priuate man and the Church is moſt notorious. The Firſt conſidered as one ſingle and priuate, hath no Commiſſion to ſpeak in Gods name, or to teach the whole Chriſtian world
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:102688:161"/> what is, or what is not Chriſt's Doctrin; The Orthodox Church is impowred to do this, or to teach nothing, if then She err's but once, the Errour makes Her infamous, redound's to the Dammage of all Chriſtians ſeduced by Her, <hi>yea and to God himſelfe,</hi> as is now declared. Hence I ſay the Church cannot teach truth by halfes, as Sectaries would haue Her, or now Hit right, now miſs. She cannot be Orthodox in à few main Matters called Fundamental, and erroneous in others. No. She is either Gods Vice-gerent in all She deliuer's as points of Faith, or in nothing. She muſt when she pretend's to ſpeak in Gods name truly do ſo, or She cannot ſpeak, nor pretend to ſpeak, but muſt be ſilent. This Verity is further laid forth in the Chapters now cited, where we treat of the Churches Infallibility.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In the mean while, if any Should Obiect The Church vainly pretend's to be ſo far an Oracle of Truth, as not to impoſe on us falſe Doctrin And then demand, from whence She had this<note place="margin">Whether our whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>courſe tend's.</note> Priuiledge of Infallibility? I Anſwer. Whoeuer trifles with ſuch obiections in this place, (to be ſolued hereafter) little vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand's the force of our Arguments. Mark I beſeech you. It is now à ſuppoſed Principle (Sectaries will haue it ſo) that the Roman Catholick Church hath forged new Articles, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the beliefe of them on Chriſtians which God neuer Reuealed. Grant thus much, She iniures God, ſin's damnably, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is no Orthodox Church, But if She neither now be Orthodox, nor was ſo ten Ages before Luther, There was not then, nor is yet any true Chriſtian Church in the world, <hi>And conſequently Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Pray, where shall we find knowledge if ignorance haue place here? Such ignorance may perhaps be in ſome particular men, But to Tax à whole Church with it, is not only to make ſo many Councils, ſo many profound Doctors as haue taught the world worſe than Idiots for à thouſand years, but it is to iniure Chriſt, to tell Him he has indeed eſtablished à Church, yet mark'd it ſo obſcurely, remoued it ſo far out of the Sight of Chriſtians, that the moſt learned of all could not diſcouer the Truths it taught for ten long Ages, though all Antiquity Aſſures vs that Chriſt's Church is one of the moſt manifeſt things in the world.

It ſtood all that vaſt time inuincible againſt Hereſy, and was neuer ſtained with falſe Doctrin. The Truth is indubitably owned by Chriſt our Lord, who came not to change ſo much as one <hi>iota</hi> of Doctrin taught by the Prophets, but only to perfect it by reuealing other Verities, not explicitly known before. Now Mark à ſtrange Paradox auouched by Sectaries. They ſay boldly, That our Chriſtian Catholick Roman Church which certainly God Himſelfe eſtablished, And enriched with his own Verities, only continued Orthodox for Three or Four Ages, and then (O diſmal time) left off to be what it was; loſt Chriſts reuealed Truths, became the whore of Babylon, Apoſtated from it Selfe, and cheated the world into falſe Doctrin. What ſaies the prudent Reader? Is it Poſſible that the Ancient Church of<note place="margin">Drawn from à moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable Aſſertion of Sectaries.</note> the Patriarchs and Prophets ſtood without change or blemish for 4. or 5.

If contrarywiſe they own à pure Orthodox Church to haue been on earth when the Roman began to erre, <hi>That</hi> (becauſe Orthodox and pure) was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly à Society of Chriſtians diſtinct from the then ſuppoſed fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and falſe Church of Rome.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence I argue. Eirher that Orthodox diſtinct Church, ſenſible of Gods cauſe and the Honour of Chriſtian Faith, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouly oppoſed, cenſured and condemned thoſe imagined errours of the Roman Church now fallen, or Careleſly let all alone, and omitted that Duty. If it omitted that duty, it was no true Church, For if true, Her Charge was and is, (She hath à command from Chriſt to do it) to crush, and ſuppress falſe Doctrins, when they firſt riſe vp, or begin to infect the body of Chriſtianity. This duty that Church neglected, and for that cauſe was not Orthodox. Moreouer, the Roman is alſo Suppoſed actually drawn from Truth,<note place="margin">Clear and Conuincing.</note> Condemned Hereticks made vp no Church. We had then in thoſe daies à ſtrange world indeed, when Chriſt the Supreme
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:102688:163"/> Head looked down from Heauen, and ſaw his Myſtical body the Church pitifully Corrupted, when he caſt an eye vpon poor Chriſtians, and found them all Churchless.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If Sectaries own ſuch an Orthodox Society, which oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and cenſured the Roman Errours, that muſt be à Truth as <hi>Notoriouſly known</hi> to the world as it is now ſuppoſed, that the Church of Rome had Errours <hi>Notoriouſly known.</hi> And Here I deſire the Iudicious Reader to reflect on what I Shall propoſe, And wish our Aduerſaries to Anſwer. Can they Imagine the Errours of the Roman Church openly diſcouered ſo many Centuries ſince, and judge that no Orthodox Chriſtians then liuing (who beheld Truth run to ruin) made Oppoſition againſt them? The Errours, ſay Proteſtants, were palpable (for our new men eſpy them now) yet no Orthodox Chriſtans are heard of to this day, who then ſtood vp for Gods cauſe, and defended the Ancient truths of Chriſt againſt this ſuppoſed erring Church, This yet lies in darkness The Fault muſt be noiſed as both criminal and publick, And yet there is no newes at all of ſuch as lent à helping hand to redreſs it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, Can it be imagined that the Roman Catholick Church which Age after Age condemned innumerable Hereticks, And giues in an exact Catologue in order as They roſe vp, (The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<note place="margin">Sectaries Paradoxes and.</note> particulars are exactly known) And yet that no Author, Friend or Enemy Can bee found, who giues ſo much as the leaſt hint of any ſound Chriſtians that condemned the now decryed Errours of this one Church? Finally (and here is the wonder) muſt we ſuppoſe our Church to haue groſly erred à thouſand years ſince, when yet all good Chriſtians were ſilent and reprehended it not, And that now after ten whole Ages are paſt, And Millions of Souls damned for want of Faith, A company of iarring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Can probably begin to talk of them, to Reproue, to Argue,<note place="margin">Vaſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities</note> and offer to ſettle Chriſtianity right vpon its old Fundations? No thought of man can fall vpon more deſperate improbabilities, yet they paſs as current among Sctaries. But of this point more hereafter in the 13 Chapter.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:102688:164"/>6. Now here is the Concluſion, and the true Trial of this cauſe. It is poſſible that our new men, who pretend knowledge in Antiquity, name an Orthodox Church which openly Proteſted<note place="margin">What Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are obliged to doe, but Cannot.</note> againſt theſe ſuppoſed Errours before Proteſtants were in Being. It is poſſible to tell vs when this Church ſtrongly Acted againſt the Roman Errours. It is Poſſible to ſay what became of that Orthodox Church at laſt, whether after it had done that great work and Cenſured the Roman Doctrin, It quickly diſappeared, Or ſtill remain's in the world. It is I ſay, Poſſible, that Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Euidence theſe particulars of moſt high Concern, or impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, If the firſt can be done, we Catholicks ought to Reform. But I muſt vnbeguile the Reader, and abſolutly Aſſert. All the Proteſtants who now are, or shall bee hereafter, Shall as ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all Chriſtian Faith as name any Orthodox Society, any thing like à true Church which cenſured theſe ſuppoſed Roman Errours, Therefore (And it is an euident Demonſtration) Our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church once true, continued ſo in all Ages, Or there was none in the world Orthodox, The Articles She maintained then, and yet defend's are no Errours, but Primitiue Verities. And thus the whole Plea of our new men Concerning Errours entring the Church <hi>de facto,</hi> ends as it deſerues in à flat Calumny. What do they think to bring Errours to light now, whereof the moſt learned Churches in the world neuer took notice before? Will they ſpeak of falſe Doctrins when all Orthodox Societies ſaid nothing of them? Dare they accuſe and condemn à Church which Millions of Souls ſo highly reuerenced that the beſt of Chriſtians liued and dyed happily in it? Nothing can be more exotical. Wherefore I ſay, when our Nouelliſts can work this Perſwaſion into mens minds, That Crowes once white, turned black in time (though no body muſt ſay when) Then, and not<note place="margin">Their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</note> before, they may perhaps hope to make vs mad, and induce All to belieue, that our Church Anciently pure became tainted in time with gross Errours, though when or in what Age this deformity appeared they know not, nor Can euer know, becauſe the Change is <hi>de ſubiecto non ſupponente,</hi> not ſuppoſable.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:102688:164"/>7. One may reply. Though the Sectary cannot point at an Orthodox Church which condemned theſe now Suppoſed Roman Errours, yet he has plenty of witneſſes to ground his Aſſertion vpon, For in paſt Ages, many, though reputed Hereticks, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently decryed the Doctrins of our Church as <hi>Nouelties</hi> Swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from the primitiue Truths. Anſw: Very true indeed. For thus Arius of old decryed <hi>Conſubſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But what is all this to the purpoſe? which yet to my great wonder I find vrged by ſome? Is the Authority of theſe condemned and confeſſedly known Hereticks, preciſely conſidered, to be parallell'd with à Church<note place="margin">The Votes of Aduerſaries without Proofs, weightless.</note> which was neuer condemned by Orthodox Chriſtians? Muſt the condemned Party be heard when it Accuſes, And the Innocent or neuer cenſured Church be Suppoſed guilty, after the whole world held her blamless and has iudged well of Her condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions pas't vpon Hereticks? Compare I ſay, the Authority of the Church time out of mind proued Innocent, with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Hereticks known moſt guilty, There can be no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, may we preciſely reſpect Authority. Wherefore if the Oppoſition of Hereticks hath any force, Their charge againſt the Church muſt ſtand vpon Strong proofs and ſound Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples diſtinct from <hi>Their own voting Her Delinquent.</hi> Theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples we ſeek for in all our Diſputes with Proteſtants, yet hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto neuer heard of Any, and belieue it, Wee hold their own Authority of no greater weight than that of Arians, or, of any other condemned Hereticks.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Others, quite driuen off all ground of rational Arguing will needs faſten Errours vpon our Church, becauſe, forſooth, in ſuch an Age the 9<hi rend="sup">.th</hi> For example after Chriſt, or The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re about, ſome Popes were less good and People much debauched.<note place="margin">An other ſimple Plea.</note> Then, moſt likely, was the Nick of time, Say theſe, to bring in <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> the Popes <hi>Supremacy</hi> and what other Errour
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:102688:165"/> you will. Anſw. A moſt pitiful Plea, not worth the paper it blot's. I shall not ſo much refute it, for it merit's not the labour, As Shew how it deſtroyes the Belief of all Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Pray you conſider Chriſtianity in the greateſt Latitude Imaginable. Call <hi>Arians, Donatists, Proteſtants</hi> And <hi>Catholicks</hi> alſo Chriſtians. Grant, which is true, that there haue been very wicked men amongſt theſe different Profeſſors. I ſay if this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haue weight. <hi>Some few Popes, and many People were not good for</hi> one Age chiefly, <hi>Ergo debauchery in manners more then probably brought in falſe Doctrins vnder the Notion of Christian Truths,</hi> A Iew or Gentil may Argue as well, and infer that Viciousness of life hath deſtroyed all Truth among Chriſtians, if euer They had any. For why should lewdness haue less force to Subuert all Truth taught by the Church of Rome than ſome only? It hath, ſay Sectaries, brought in much Errour, Therefore, ſaith the Iew, it may as well haue corrupted all Chriſt Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To reinforce this Argument, I told you aboue, if the Church of Rome, had but once propoſed one Article to be belieued by Diuine Faith, which is falſe, She is not to be<note place="margin">reiected and proued un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reaſonable</note> credited in any thing. If you Reply, it is euident That though falſe in many Tenets, She yet taught ſome Articles true, As <hi>that Chriſt is our Redeemer.</hi> The Iew Anſwers, and ſo do I too, She Taught and teaches ſo ſtill; but that <hi>This is Truth,</hi> if debauchery of life bee ineuitably connexed with falſe Doctrin, shall neuer be made Probable, For this Church is either entierly ſound in Doctrin, or Entirely deluded. One may Say. Scripture is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently plain for ſome Primary Articles of Chriſtian belief. Anſw. The Iew ſcorn's the Reply, and maintain's this Truth, as I alſo do. If it be once proued that the Church of Rome impoſed on the Chriſtian world Falshood in place of Truth, <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> The <hi>Sacrifice on the Altar</hi> &amp;c. She may as eaſily haue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the whole Bible and made that Book falſe in à hundred important Paſſages, whereof enough is ſaid in the other Treatiſe. No true Church Therefore, no Probability of true Scripture.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Let vs now proceed to others called Chriſtians the moſt
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:102688:165"/> known Arch-hereticks, you will haue the ſame Concluſion. Arius for example, à ſtubborn proud Fellow had many Aſſociates like Himſelf, yea and certainly taught ſome Doctrins falſe, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Saith the Iew, All He deliuered was falſe alſo. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel learned Luther to broach His new Goſpel, and the mans enormous Viciouſness is known to the world by as credible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors as <hi>Platina</hi> or <hi>Nico: de Clemangijs,</hi> who make Popes and People ſo impious, Therefore all that Luther taught cannot but bee vpon the Argument propoſed, moſt iuſtly excepted againſt<note place="margin">An other Simple Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, reiected.</note> as pernicious Doctrin; For groſs Errours like à Torrent follow Deprauation in manners. Caluins Pride, Deceipt, and Couſenage, to ſay nothing of that hidious Sin for which he was branded, are vpon Record, And all know what Rebellion, what tragical Doings enſued vpon the wicked mans Apoſtasy. Who then can harbour ſo much as à good thought of any Doctrin He taught euen that Chriſt dyed for vs? Hence, ſaith the Iew, if Wickednes of life and Errours in Doctrin be ſuch inſeparable Companions And all Sects or Religions nameable haue had Profeſſors wicked, Farewel Chriſtianity, yea and Chriſt Himſelf alſo. For, if the Impiety of ſome, lead's Erroneous Doctrins into à whole Moral Body, that one crying Sin of Iudas might more eaſily haue corrupted the Firſt Apoſtolical Colledge ſmal in Number, Than the incomparable leſſe defects of Popes depraue the great Moral Body of the Church. O, but Chriſt ſecured the other Apoſtles from Errour. Anſw. So he doth his Church, And the Iew will as ſoon belieue the one as the other, who Argues thus.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Chriſtianity was neuer without Sin, Ergo neuer without Errour, if the Argum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Again. By what law do theſe men Suppoſe that God preſerued not his Church Holy in thoſe dayes? Doth it follow becauſe ſome were wicked that She loſt all Sanctity? Will they Say if the English Church had euer Sanctity in it, All vanished into Smoak in the late diſſentions and deplorable Tumults? There were neuer ſuch Doings at Rome in the worſt of daies as England then Shewed to the world. O but there were then many Holy and Godly men that ſuffered. Be it ſo at preſent, I loue not to recriminate. For one of yours Holy, we had Thouſands in that<note place="margin">Particular Abuſe can not unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Church</note> Age you except againſt the whole world ouer, in <hi>England Germany, Spain, France, Denmark</hi> &amp;c. moſt humble, pious, virtuous and profoundly learned.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What do you think, that à few Abuſes in Italy not half ſo bad as you make them, can <hi>Vnhallow</hi> an ample Church? Yet here lies the Strength of your weak Argument. The iniquity of ſome, chiefly of Popes and Prelates ruins not ſanctity only, But moreouer induceth Errour into the whole Moral Body of Chriſt. You iuſt proceed, as if One should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempt to proue that à goodly Building, which yet viſibly ſtands fair to the Eye, and firm on Sure foundations, is all shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and pulled down, becauſe you can lead à man to the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places of it and show him in it ſome Naſtiness. The Inſtance is moſt Pertinent. You find filth Here and there in the fair Houſe of God, and though there be more of it before your own doores, yet your Church muſt be ſuppoſed Holy and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, And ours contrarywiſe falſe and impious.</p>
               <p n="14">14.

               <argument>
                  <p>Manifeſt and moſt vndeniable Miracles peculiar to the Romani Catholick Church only, prone Her Orthodox, withall show that She ſtill retain's the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Doctrin.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BY this word <hi>Miracle,</hi> or <hi>Miracles,</hi> I vnderſtand à ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural work done by Almighty God aboue the power and force of Nature. For there is no doubt, but that God, who<note place="margin">What is meant by Miracles.</note> created Nature, has within his boundles Omnipotency Superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent effects of Grace, which far ſurpass the little <hi>Might</hi> of all Creatures made by him. Theſe are finite; The Author of them infinite, And can do more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 2. This Principle is certain. God hath wrought innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Miracles, not only to Teſtify He can do more then Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Why Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are wrought.</note> but with this express Deſigne alſo, that by the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch wonders, All may come to the knowledge of thoſe
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:102688:168"/> Oracles whereby He ſpeaks, and Reueals moſt ſublime Myſteries far aboue the reach of our weak Reaſon. Now whether theſe Oracles be Prophets, Church, or Apoſtles, ſeems one and the ſame thing, If they be equally Manifeſted by miraculous Effects, and ſpeak in his name who Aſſumes them to teach the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſay <hi>manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſted Oracles by Signes,</hi> And ſay it for this End, That all may reflect vpon the depth of Diuine wiſdom, which may on the one ſide Seem too rigorous in obliging vs to belieue moſt Difficult Myſteries, neither ſeen by Eye nor heard by eare,<note place="margin">They facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>Were it not, That on the other ſide,</hi> the burden is leſſened and our Faith much facilitated by the Euidence of moſt prudent and conuincing Motiues, For t'is à great Truth. <hi>Non ſine teſtimoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> reliquit Semetipſum benefaciens de Caelo.</hi> His Goodnes ſo fauorably condeſcend's to our weaknes, that though he remoues not <hi>Vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence</hi> and Obſcurity from the Myſteries belieued, Yet he makes them all ſo euidently Credible to prudent Reaſon (<hi>Benefaciens de Caelo</hi>) by the Luſtre of Signes and Wonders, That the man who belieues not after à Sight had of ſuch glorious Marks, ſtand's guilty before Gods Tribunal of damnable Sin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The third Principle. Miracles eminently great in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and quality (for example the raiſing of the dead to life) Chiefly, when wrought by Perſons of Singular virtue to Confirm our Chriſtian Faith, are from God, and euident Signes leading to the knowledge of true Religion. None can doubt of the Aſſertion, ſeing Chriſt our Mord. <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. When Queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whether He was the true Meſſias, proued the Affirmatiue by his Signal Miracles. <hi>The blind ſee, the lame walk, Lepers are Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And lead to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of true Religion.</note> 
                  <hi>the deaf hear, the dead riſe again</hi> &amp;c. Which is to ſay in other Terms. Theſe wonders ſpeak in my behalfe, and plainly Teſtify that I am the <hi>Meſsias;</hi> For only to ſay, I am à <hi>Prophet</hi> ſent from God without prouing the Truth to Reaſon by Signes and wonders Conuinces nothing, Induces none to Belieue. Therefore <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10. Chriſt remitted the vnbelieuing Iewes not to the Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Doctrin, (for really no Doctrin of Myſteries aboue Reaſon, though moſt true, is or can be its own Self-eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:102688:169"/> But to his manifeſt Miracles. <hi>The Works which I do in the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our Sauiour pleaded by His Miracles.</note> 
                  <hi>name of my Father, Theſe giue Teſtimony of me.</hi> Again. <hi>If you w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt not belieue me belieue my works.</hi> Bleſſed S. Paul might haue Long preached the Sublime Doctrin of Chriſt, and without Fruit, vnless. Miracles had confirmed it, which he call's the <hi>Signes of his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They were Signes of Pauls apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leship.</note> 
                  <hi>Apoſtleship. 2. Cor.</hi> 12. And How long think ye would Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodonozer haue remained in his Idolatry vnless He had beheld that prodigious Wonder wrought by God vpon the three Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites in the fiery Fournace. <hi>Daniel</hi> 3. But when he ſaw them walk in the flames nothing hurt, He cryed out. <hi>Bleſſed be the God of Sydrack Miſack and Abdenago, who hath ſent his Angel</hi> &amp;c. Miracles therefore are powerful Inducements to Beliefe, which Truth might be yet more largely demonſtrated by the Wonders of Moſes, of Elias of the Prophets and Apoſtles, But theſe I waue and briefly take notice of our Sauiours ſacred words Iohn 15. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they should not haue finned,</hi> but now they haue no excuſe of their ſin &amp;c. And to show, that <hi>Speaking</hi> only was no ſufficient Conuiction, The Text add's. <hi>If I had not done among them works which no other man hath don, they should not haue ſinned but now they haue ſeen, and hate me, and my Father</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Three things follow from hence. Firſt That eminent Miracles of their own Nature are Marks of Chriſt's Doctrin and true Religion. 2. That Our Sauiour moſt iuſtly condemned<note place="margin">Why the Iewes were taxed of Incredulity?</note> the Iewes of infidelity, not ſo much for reiecting his word or Preaching, as for not belieuing after they had ſeen it confirmed by Wonder's from Heauen, For t'is Said plainly. <hi>Had they not ſeen they had not ſinned.</hi> A Doctrin Therefore atteſted by Miraculous ſignes, and wonders renders the Vnbelieuer guilty of Infidelity: Conſider it alone, deueſted of ſuch Marks, what haue we? High Myſteries preached, <hi>But without Proofs</hi> antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently laid forth to Reaſon; Truths taught, but yet vnknown whether ſo or otherwiſe. In à word we haue the Decrees of à great Monarch obliging all to ſubmiſſion, but without his <hi>Seal,</hi> or <hi>Signature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:102688:169"/>6. And Hence it is that our bleſſed Lord impowred thoſe firſt great Maſters of the Goſpel <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. not only to teach his Sacred Verities, but to teach <hi>Perſwaſiuely,</hi> by the vertue of Miracles. <hi>Goe and preach, ſaying the Kingdome of God is at hand Cure the ſick, raiſe vp the dead, cleanſe the Lepers, Caſt out Diuels</hi> &amp;c. And they did ſo. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 20. They <hi>Went abroad, preached euery where, God Cooperating with them, and confirming their Doctrin by Signes wich followed,</hi> Or to ſpeak in the words of S. Paul. <hi>Heb. 2. God withall Teſtifying by Signes and wonders and diuers Miracles</hi> &amp;c. A third ſequele. If the Iewes had not ſinned by reiecting Chriſt<note place="margin">Why ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are blameable?</note> and his Doctrin (which then was new) in caſe he had not wrought greater Miracles amongſt them than euer Any did before him, How highly imprudent think ye. How notoriouſly culpable are our Sectaries who belieue the new opinions of one wretched Luther or Caluin, without ſo much as one Miracle wrought, to make them probable?</p>
               <p n="7">7. A fourth Principle. True Real Miracles are Still neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the Church and fortold to be ſo, by Truth it ſelf. Ioan 12. <hi>Amen, Amen, I ſay vnto you, he that belieues in me, the works which I doe he shall doe, and greater works than theſe shall he doe. I ſay purpoſely, True real Miracles,</hi> mindful of <hi>S. Chriſostoms</hi> profound Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vpon theſe very words in his Book againſt the Gentils. <hi>There haue been, ſaith</hi> the Saint <hi>certain Maſters (you may call them Impoſtors</hi>) who had their Diſciples and talk't much of Wonders whilſt they liued; but none of them euer came to the impudency<note place="margin">S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſloms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</note> as truely to Propheſy of Miracles to be done by them after death. No: <hi>A Iugler may do ſomething ſtrange, whilſt he is on the Stage, But take him off the Theater, Throwe him out of this life, The cheat appeares, He is worth nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. All is contrary in our Sauiour, who here foretold of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Wonders to be wrought in after Ages by his true Belieuers, Than He had done in this Mortal life. And if we Speak of great Conuerſions (which all moſt iuſtly account Miraculous) the Truth is Euident, For our Bleſſed Lord conuerted but few, in Compariſon of thoſe who followed in the Church after his Death.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102688:170"/> (A parallel of other Miracles we shall ſee preſently). Yet more.<note place="margin">The Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les wrought the greateſt Miracles after Chriſt's Aſcenſion.</note> And t'is worth Reflection, whilſt Chriſts Diſciples conuerſed with Him, the Goſpel record's little of their Miracles, But after his leauing this world Signes followed them, <hi>They caſt out Diuels, raiſed the dead, ſpake with new tongues,</hi> conuerted Nations, laid hand on the Sick, &amp;c. And the like Supernatural effects haue been viſible in the Church through all Ages after the Apoſtles. So true are the words of Chriſt. <hi>Greater Things shall be done.</hi> And the meaning is not, that euery true Belieuer should work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, (For ſo Chriſts promiſe would not bee truly fulfilled, <hi>becauſe All do them not</hi>) But that ſome choiſe elected of his Church, as it happened in the Primitiue times, Members of this Myſtical Body, should haue the Priuiledge.</p>
               <p n="9">9. One Reaſon of my Aſſertion is. If Miracles, Gods own <hi>Seals</hi> and <hi>Characters,</hi> were Neceſſary at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel to induce all to belieue Chriſts Doctrin, or to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish his Truths from the Errours of Iewes and Pagans, The like Neceſſity is for their Continuance in after Ages, not only in reſpect of Infidels, but erring Chriſtians alſo. For, no ſooner had Chriſt founded his Church, But the Diuel raiſed vp his Chappel by it, Peſtiferous Hereticks from Simon Magus, haue<note place="margin">Why Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are now Neceſſary?</note> been in euery Age his Chaplins. All of them Pretended to Truth, with an <hi>Ecce hic eſt Chriſtus,</hi> Loe we preach Chriſt. In this Confuſion of Sects, it was abſolutly needful, to Mark out that happy Chriſtian Society which taught ſauing Faith and Shewed where God was adored in Spirit and Truth. Now no Mark can be more Palpable or more attractiue, than the Glory of indubitable Miracles, Chriſts own Cogniſances, and the Cleareſt Euidences of Apoſtolical Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="10">10. 2. Miracles are neceſſary in the Church to ſtirr vp Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, and Deuotion with it, which would ſoon grow cold,<note place="margin">Two other Reaſons alleged.</note> were it not that Diuine Prouidence frequently quickens both, by theſe exteriour Signes and wonders. Wherefore, as His Goodnes works inwardly and plyes our hearts with Grace, ſo outwardly alſo (to Teſtify that nothing is wanting) He moues vs to Belieue
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102688:170"/> by no less viſible Inducements than Thoſe were, which firſt made the world Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="11">11. 3. The Continuation of Miracles Clearly appeared in the firſt fiue Centuries after Chriſt, And as Authority makes them indubitable, So reaſon alſo proues them neceſſary vpon this very Account, that the Conuerſion of Infidels ſtrangers to Chriſt, was not wrought on à ſuddain, or all at once, But ſucceſſiuely Age after Age, If then Miracles were neceſſary to conuince our Chriſtian Verities when Chriſt and his Apoſtles firſt preached to vnbelieuing Iewes and Gentils, no man can probably iudge them Vſeless in after Ages, when the like Barbarous, the like Ignorant and vnciuilized Nations who neuer heard of Chriſt or Scripture became Chriſtians, Induced, to ſo happy à change, not becauſe they <hi>heard truths Taught,</hi> But becauſe they ſaw all confirmed by <hi>Euident Signes</hi> and Wonders.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Reflect I beſeech you à little. Were not the Natiues of thoſe vaſt and remote Regions we call the Indies (whether Orient or Occident) à People as ignorant of our Chriſtian verities and as much auerted from Chriſts Doctrin, when <hi>S. Francis Xauerius,</hi> and other laborious Miſſioners firſt preached There, as any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note place="margin">One Reaſon further illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated</note> were to whom the Apoſtles preached Chriſt? Yes moſt certainly. In both caſes the diſdain and ignorance may well be paralled. Imagin now that <hi>S. Xauerius</hi> had only opened his Bible; And told the ruder People of the high Myſteries of Chriſtian Faith, would this think ye, though neuer ſo ſpeciouſly laid forth, haue gained credit? No. But when their eyes beheld Miracles, and glorious Miracles accompaning His laborious Preaching; The<note place="margin">By an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Miſſioners ſent to preach</note> deaf, dumb, blind, and ſick inſtantly cured. When they ſaw the Sanctity, the Auſterity and Innocency of His virtuous Life. When they heard him indued with the Giſts of tongues. When they knew that after à noble contempt of the world, The bleſſed man ſought nothing but God, And fearing neither death nor dangers Couragiouſly trauelled from one end of the world to the other &amp;c. Then it was they began to look about them, to open their eyes more, to Renounce Idolatry and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:102688:171"/> to Gods truths, moſt manifeſtly euidenced by glorious Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Then it was that the Saint (Gods grace concurring) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted Thouſands and Thouſands, All which is vpon certain Record, and witneſſed by thoſe who haue written the wonders. Howeuer grant that <hi>S. Xauerius</hi> wrought but one or two Miracles (when many more cannot without impudency be denyed him) our Aſſertion ſubſists, that Miracles are neceſſary, for the reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Infidels, And if he did none at all, This as <hi>S Auſtin</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently obſerued vpon à like occaſion, is the greateſt Wonder of all, That he conuerted innumerable Heathens to our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, without Miracles.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I I ſay firſt. Clear and Vnqueſtionable Miracles, of the like Quality with thoſe which Chriſt and his Apoſtles wrought, haue been euer ſince, moſt gloriouſly manifeſt in the Roman Catholick Church, And in no other Society of Chriſtians, I hope none for Proof of my Aſſertion can expect that I write Volumes, or bring to light again in this short Treatiſe ſo much as the hundred Part of thoſe prodigious wonders which are vpon Record in the liues of Saints, in the death of Martyrs, and Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.

               <p n="2">2. Chriſt Spake Truth in the Text now cited. <hi>Iohn 14. 12. Propheſying of future glorious Miracles to be wrought by thoſe vvho be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued</hi>

                  <hi>in him.</hi> But the indubitable Miracles wrought in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church <hi>only,</hi> through euery age proue that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy exactly fulfilled, or <hi>effectually</hi> Euidence the Verity of it; Therefore none can doubt of Miracles done in the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, if Chriſts Prediction be true, and this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be alſo proued. viz. That, This Church only, hath effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually manifeſted the truth of that Propheſy, or shewn ſuch Wonders as haue proportion with Chriſts own glorious works, and the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now to clear the Truth, Here is my Principle. When I read à Propheſy in Scripture, I ſubmit to it by Faith, but when I See it actually Accomplished or made manifeſt by real viſible Effects And both Senſe and vndoubted Hiſtory diſcouer ſo much euidently, Reaſon, grounded on Senſe and Hiſtory, Can not but prudently aſſent to the Verity. What I would ſay is clear in all the Ancient Propheſies of Chriſt, and his Church. Take this one inſtance. The Prophets, <hi>Daniel</hi> chiefly and <hi>Eſay,</hi> Foretold of the large Extent of Chriſts glorious Kingdom here on earth, of<note place="margin">The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whereon, our Aſſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. Hence I diſcourſe further, and Aſſert, that the glorious
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:102688:172"/> Miracles which ſtand vpon indubitable Record, and haue been done in the Roman Church only, moſt notoriouſly Euidence without Diſpute the actual Accomplisment of our Sauiours own words. <hi>The works which I do, he shall do alſo and greater than theſe shall he do.</hi> If you Ask how I proue the Aſſertion? I appeal to Senſe and certain Hiſtory.

                  <hi>Cured the Sick, changed the minds of men to the better, and raiſed vp the dead.</hi> Now if you will hear of S. Bernards own Miracles, Read Godfridus who liued with him. <hi>Lib. 4. C.</hi> 4. and wrote His life, you haue innumerable. T'is hard, ſaith Bellarmin, to Recount all, And as numberles are the known Miracles of thoſe two admirable, Saints Bleſſed S. <hi>Dominick</hi> and the <hi>Seraphical</hi> S. <hi>Francis,</hi> Founders of two moſt glorious Religious Orders. S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> To omit his other certain wonders, was Himſelf à Miracle of Auſterity and Pennance. The like was S. Dominick, who as we read in his life raiſed three dead men to life. And for three you haue more reuiued by an other of His holy Order, I mean that admirable Saint <hi>Vincentius Ferrerius.</hi> So the pious and learned S. Antoninus Arch-Bishop of Florence Recounts in his Hiſtpry. 3. <hi>Part lib.</hi> 23. And who dares ſay that ſo great à Doctor And moſt modeſt Prelate, was ſo Frontless as to write that we read, not long after the death of S. <hi>Vincentius,</hi> without Aſſurance and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. The whole world would haue decryed the Folly, Had it been à Fourb, an Impoſture; or à fabulous Story.</p>
               <p n="7">7. By what is now ſaid of Theſe and other infinit Operations of grace which I am forced to omit, you may inferr firſt. That the Miracles wrought in the Roman Catholick Church are not
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:102688:173"/> inferiour to thoſe done by the Apoſtles, And conſequently if our<note place="margin">Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy falfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Churches Miracles.</note> Sauiours Propheſy was ſeen manifeſtly fulfilled in thoſe firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Wonders, it hath been alſo as effectually accomplished in theſe latter of the Church. I ſay, in <hi>the Roman Catholick Church,</hi> For all thoſe now named, whom God priuiledged with the Grace of working Miracles, were of the ſame vnion in Faith with this Church, and no other. It followes. 2. That Humane Faith, when no iuſt Exception comes againſt it, But the fool-hardy Spirit of vnbelieuing Heathens and Hereticks, giues Mortal Aſſurance of Miracles. The Miracles of our Sauiour euidence this Truth. He raiſed Lazarus from death. <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. A Touch of his garment cured the infirm woman. Matt. 9. He reſtored ſight to à blind man. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9. Obſerue I beſeech you. All Iewry beheld not theſe Wonders, But ſome only, Yet they were wrought for the good of All, and without doubt proued conuincing Arguments of Chriſt's great power to innumerable, who actually ſaw them not, But only heard of them, and <hi>Aſſented to what they heard,</hi> vpon<note place="margin">Miracles made Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vpon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> humane Authority prudently credible. Therefore our Sauiour Suppoſed That humane Faith (and this before the writing of Scripture) was à Sufficient Means to conuey to <hi>others à Moral certainty</hi> of his Miracles. I ſay yet more. If God euer efficaciouſly intended to worck à true Miracle ſince the Creation of the world by any of his creatures, Humane Faith was, and yet is the <hi>First</hi> and moſt <hi>Connatural</hi> way of Conueying it to the knowledge of others. Who therefore excepts againſt this vſual courſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence deſtroies à Principle of Nature, and can belieue nothing of Supernatural Effects, but what he either ſees with his own eyes, or find's regiſtred in Holy Writ.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Ask now. How many <hi>Auſtins,</hi> How many <hi>Chryſoſtoms,</hi> how many <hi>Cyrills,</hi> how many <hi>Bedes</hi> and <hi>Bernards,</hi> haue vpon their Credit, and Reputation aſſured vs of Miracles wrought in the Roman Church only, like to thoſe in the Primitiue Age? They are numberless. Did Chriſt our Lord reſtore life to the dead, ſight to the blind, health to the ſick? The Profeſſors of our Catholick Church, by his virtue, haue done the very ſame, and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102688:173"/> the Miracles are more numerous. But now, and here is the chief demand. Were our Sauiours glorious Works made Credible to<note place="margin">Authority alleged.</note> thouſands no Eye-witneſſes vpon Humane faith and Authority, before Scripture regiſtred them? So it is. Behold we haue our <hi>Auſtins,</hi> our <hi>Iustins,</hi> our <hi>Baſils,</hi> our <hi>Bernards</hi> vnexceptionably plain for the Churches Miracles, and none can without Impudency, and the violation of all humane Credit, probably Cauil at what the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe haue written. None can without making very Saints Impoſtors and guilty of that enormous ſin of groſly deceiuing Poſterity, pare away ſo much as any ſubſtantial parcel of what is Recorded. Therefore vnless all humane Faith perish, its deſperate rashness to deny moſt glorious Miracles to haue been in the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, which was my Aſſertion.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And to confirm it more. I Ask why do Sectaries to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace our Miracles, introduce, I know not what Stories of the Heathens wonders? Are theſe credible or no? If not; reiect them boldly as Impertinences; If Credible, it ſeems humane Faith is of ſome weight with Sectaries when they read of the Heathens fopperies, though of no Account for true Miracles wrought by the Church of Chriſt. Again, this Faith is much worth with theſe men, when to lay à foul Aſperſion on à Pope<note place="margin">Sectaries in Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> or Prelate, they fill their Books with à hundred petty Stories, whether true or false imports little. Herein their eaſy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe ſwallowes all, But if à Father or Choiſe Hiſtorian mention à Miracle, its à <hi>Fourb,</hi> à <hi>dream,</hi> à <hi>fiction,</hi> and what not.</p>
               <p n="10">10. One word more and I end. A meer pretended Humane Authority, which really is not, And therefore nothing worth, is shamefully made vſe of to patronize that crying Sin of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Schiſm. Our Church, Say they, Changed Her ancient Faith, the Charge at moſt relies on Hiſtory or Humane Faith, God neuer told them ſo. For example. The Lateran Council firſt brought in the Doctrin of <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> ſome Pope or other firſt inuented Purgatory &amp;c. Suppoſe all this were as true, as t'is hideouſly falſe, Hiſtory or nothing muſt make it good, and yet in our preſent caſe it is no warrant for known Miracles. Thus
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:102688:174"/> Faith riſeth and fall's in value as our New mens fancy pleaſes. Belieue it, had bleſſed S. Ambroſe (cited aboue), in lieu of that Miraculous Cure wrought on à blind man at Millan, when Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was preſent (and innumerable of that Citty ſaw the wonder) related à ſtroy preiudicial to either Pope or Clergy, How often think you would that haue been told and reiterated in the Writings oſ Sectaries? But now when Hee ſpeaks of à ſupernatural Work of grace, done at the Reliques of the holy Martyrs Gerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius<note place="margin">Humane Faith now Valuable now not with Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> and Protaſius, not à word is ſaid. No, all paſſes in Silence, as if Chriſts own Marks and the Churches glory (vndoubted Miracles) deſerued no Memory, but Contrarywiſe Scorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I ſaid in the Aſſertion, that the grace of true Miracles, (meaning ſuch as exactly Anſwer to our Sauiours glorious works) is proper and peculiar to the Roman Church only. The proof hereof is eaſy. Firſt, Sectaries pretend not to work Miracles, For they ſay, that power ceaſed long ſince, though I might here mind them of Caluins great wonder, and really it was à ſtrange one, For whereas God's Saints reſtored life to the dead, this great Sinner, hauing perſwaded one <hi>Bruleus</hi> of Oſtun to fain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf dead, depriued the poor wretch of his life Or, rather God<note place="margin">Caluins Miracle.</note> to lay open the fraud and Hypocriſy of both the one and other, turned the <hi>Fiction</hi> into à <hi>Verity,</hi> for really Bruleus who Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited himſelf dead, to get Caluin the renown of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, was after all the Miniſters long prayer, found dead indeed. The ſtory is known and writ not only by <hi>Hierome Bolsec</hi> in <hi>Vita Calvini.</hi> C. 13. But by others alſo. And here I wish Sectaries to giue ſome credit to humane Authority.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now as Proteſtants diſclaim Miracles, ſo do the Iewes alſo, for they neuer had any after our Sauiours Comming. T'is<note place="margin">Sectaries Iewes and Turks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> true, that Pond vpon Probatica. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 5. Or as many will haue it, the Pond it ſelf, ſo called becauſe the Sheep ordained to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice were washed there, continued Miraculous, whilſt Chriſt our Lord preached, But ſoon after ceaſed, And ſo do all other wonders amongſt that abandoned People. The Turks who ſay.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:102688:174"/> God gaue Mahomet the ſword and Chriſt the Power of working Miracles, pretend to no ſuch ſupernatural effects at all. No more in Iuſtice can Heathens or the Donatiſts lay Claim to any, whoſe wonders were but trifles, compared with the Glorious works of Chriſt and His Church. None of them all conuerted whole Nations to Chriſtian Religion, none of them raiſed vp the dead. None of them after death wrought any Miracles. See Tertullian writing of the Heathens. In <hi>Apolog:</hi> C. 22. 23. And <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> againſt the Donatiſts. <hi>Homil. 13. in Ioan. De Vtilit. Credent. C.</hi> 16. As <hi>alſo Lib. 10. de Ciuit.</hi> C. 16.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I ſay. 2. If the Miracles of Chriſt and the Apoſtles ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally proued againſt Iewes and Gentils, the <hi>Credibility</hi> of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical<note place="margin">The ancient and modern Miracles compared together.</note> Doctrin, The very like Signes and ſupernatural effects moſt euident in the Roman Catholick Church, as rationally proue againſt Sectaries the <hi>Credibility</hi> of our now profeſſed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrin. I would ſay. Church Miracles conſtantly wrought in all Ages ſince Chriſtianity began, are no less effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to draw Sectaries to the Belief of our Church Doctrin, than thoſe the Apoſtles wrought were to induce Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils to the belief of Apoſtolical Doctrin. Here is one Proof. The ſame Signes and Marks of Truth when equal in Maieſty, Worth, Quality, and Number euer diſcouer to Reaſon the ſame Truth, For, God can no more deceiue by ſuch works of Grace than by his own Diuine word. <hi>Interrogemus ipſa Miracula</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Auſtin. Tract: 24. in Ioan: Quid nobis loquantur de Christo.</hi> Let vs ask of Miracles what they ſay of Chriſt? <hi>Habent enim ſi intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tur, linguam ſuam.</hi> They want no tongue to ſpeak with, their Language is plain for Chriſt. Iuſt ſo Say I and proue it, Church Miracles Speak as planly for the Church. Wherefore if the Roman Catholick Church moſt clearly giues in euidence of Her Miracles equal in worth, quality, and number with thoſe wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, it followes, that as thoſe firſt Apoſtolical wonders were ſufficient to conuince Iewes and Gentils of the Truth of Chriſtianity, So theſe latter alſo wrought in the Church are of like force, and no less efficacious to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:102688:175"/> conuince Sectaries of what euer Doctrin She teaches. Now pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">What the Apoſtles did, the Church doth.</note> well what the Apoſtles did. They <hi>cured the ſick, diſpoſſed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, raiſed the Dead, conuerted Nations,</hi> &amp;c. But theſe very Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles haue been done in the Roman Catholick Church, yea and greater too, <hi>Ergo</hi> we haue the like Euidence of Truth in both the primitiue Age and this, Conſequently with it the ſame Truth. The Euidence hath been partly laid forth already, and shall be further proued preſently. The Sequel is vndenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I ſay. 3. No otherwiſe, nor vpon any better ground can the Sectary Oppoſe the Miracles of our Church, than Iewes and Gentils haue oppoſed and yet doe oppoſe thoſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Obſerue well. Will the Sectary Say our Miracles are wrought by the Diuels power? So the Iewes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated Chriſt own Glorious works. Will he Say, they are only fained by poor deluded or bold-lying Catholicks? So the Iewes ſpeak of Chriſt's own Miracles to this day. Will he Say that ſome Miracles auouched true, haue been afterward euidently<note place="margin">The like op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de againſt Chriſt's Miracles and the Churches.</note> Counterfeit, and why may not thoſe the Church glories in, be rancked with ſuch? Contra. And why may not Chriſts own wonders be alſo liſted with them? The Argument, if of any force equally concludes againſt both; For if the Forgery of ſome proue all forged, Chriſt's own Miracles no more eſcape the Cenſure; than if one should ſay, (t'is S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> inſtance) all women are naught, becauſe ſome haue been ſo. Let then the Sectary show vpon good Principles That Church Miracles haue been forged, and he ſpeak's to the purpoſe. In the interim, he may well think, his bold incredulous Humour makes none for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p n="15">15. One may reply. There is à vaſt diſparity between our Sauiours Miracles regiſtred in Scripture, and thoſe we plead for, only atteſted vpon humane Faith. I Anſwer in order to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians there is à Diſparity in the <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> But that fall's from the purpoſe now. Firſt becauſe Chriſts Miracles were known and admitted vpon humane Authority, before Scripture was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:102688:175"/> 2. And chiefly, becauſe both Iewes and Gentils as much ſlight our Scripture teſtifying thoſe wonders, as the Miracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, And make little account of either.</p>
               <p n="16">16.

All came with ioyful hearts, and Firſt proſtrate on the ground with much deuotion gaue immortal thanks to God for the cure, then Embraced Marcellus who took à little ſuſtenance, which he had wanted for à long time. That done, the Superiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him forthwith to write down exactly euery particular hee had heard or ſeen that night, and to ſubſcribe all with His own hand. Hee did ſo.

I haue attentiuely conſidered what euery one ſaid, and after à diligent inquiry made, perceiue (as it euer falls out in à point of Truth) no difference amongſt them, but Contrarywiſe, find all, vnius labij<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Speak the ſame, agreeing in one Relation. But let vs omit our own witneſſes. Italy, Spaine and the other parts of the Chriſtian world neuer queſtioned the Miracle, but held it certain, and moſt prudently did ſo,</hi> For ſcarſe any thing can be more Authentick remaining within the Limits of humane Faith. <hi>Vpon this certainty it was, that His Catholick Maiesty familiarly treated with Marcellus à long time together, deſiring his prayers,</hi> and bountiffully offered all Aſſiſtance in order to his further <hi>voyage,</hi> ſo <hi>likewiſe did the Dukes and Princes of that Court. Nay, all ſort of People came flocking to the pious Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as if Hee had been one ſent from Heauen, or raiſed from the dead. Happy were they that could ſpeak with him, touch his garments, or receiue any little ſmall trifle from His hands.</hi> Thus all reuerenced the Holy man. So great Renown the Miracle had gained euery where. Much to this ſenſe Elizalde writes. Let vs now go on.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Soon after the Miraculous cure, Marcellus began his long iourney towards the Indies, and in the year 1638. arriued at <hi>Nangaſaque</hi> in Iapan, where taken priſoner, Hee firſt endured that<note place="margin">Marcellus his Martyr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome. ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and Miraculous.</note> uſual and cruel Torment of water (known to euery one) but came out ſound, not hurt at all. The ſtanders by aſtonished at the Spectacle, preſently commanded the Executioner to ſtrick of his head. The Barbarous man attempted to doe it, but on à ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain made ſtrengthles, wholly benummed, was not able to moue his hand. Where vpon Marcellus ſaid, <hi>delay no longer, but in Gods name doe thy duty.</hi> The fatal blow at thoſe very words was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, And The Virtuous Marcellus became à Martyr and dyed
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:102688:178"/> for Chriſt, according to the Propheſy of S. Xaverius.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Now here I Ask what iuſt exceptions can Sectaries make againſt this Miracle, <hi>atteſted vpon Oath, rigedly examined, and vniuerſally belieued?</hi> Will they ſay Marcellus was indeed woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">No iuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt the Miracle.</note> (for that many Seculars ſaw), yet the wound was but ſlight, not mortal and perhaps no more but à raſing of the skin? Say ſo. The Doctors and Surgeons had been worſe then beaſts, to torture the poor Patient as they did by forcing down into His Stomack the Inſtrument already mentioned. Beſides <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>

                     <hi>feauers, Conuulſion Fits, Palſies</hi> (of themſelues mortal) vſually enſue not vpon ſlighter hurts. Will they ſay The Aparition of the Saint to Marcellus was either an Illuſion, à dream at moſt, or à diſtemper of à dying mans fancy? That indeed might haue ſome colour, had wee not Euidence againſt it. For what can bee Anſwered to the ſtrange effect, the Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cure, I mean, which ſo ſuddainly followed in one short Moment of time? This (<hi>clear Self-euidence</hi>) ſpeak's truth, and proues that God had à hand in the cure. None can Cauil at it, none can contradict it. Perhaps ſome will ſay. All was à fourb, à cheat, and Fiction, The Fathers, Doctors, and Surgeons by compact fained one Mortally ſick that was not, to gain Ieſuits the renown and Glory of à Miracle.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. What's this? who are here accuſed and condemned? Giue eare à little Gentle Reader. A flat Calumny will haue vs to belieue That All thoſe venerable Fathers, thoſe expert Doctors, Thoſe experienced Surgeons, with others alſo who beheld the Miracle, All I ſay, Though they called God to witneſſe by Solemn Oath taken vpon the ſacred Goſpel, That the cure was real and Miraculous were notwithſtanding worſe<note place="margin">The juſt falſely accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> then very Villains, forſworn, baſe, abiect, and periured Perſons. And this wee muſt Aſſent to, vpon no other proof, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Malice likes well to Calumniate euer itching to decry God's own Glorious wonders. Beſides, wee muſt belieue thoſe high Tribunals where the Miracle was moſt rigidly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and after examination vnanimouſly approued, to haue
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:102688:179"/> been ſo notoriouſly vniuſt, ſo impiouſly partial, and wickedly miſled, as to oblige Poſterity to own vpon humane Faith, à Lie, an Impoſture, In à word, that to be Gods Glorious work (à true Miracle) which really was not. Is it not impudency think yee<note place="margin">Tribunals Condemned.</note> to harbour ſuch deſperate Thoughts? The Diuel himſelfe (though Father of lies) would be ashamed to calumniate ſo boldly, without ſome Colour or apparence of proof; Yet here we haue not any.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Now I'le proue the Sectaries Aſſertion to bee à flat Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, and withall further euince the truth of the Miracle. S. Xauerius, as wee haue heard, aſcertain'd Marcellus of his cure, and likewyſe <hi>Propheſyed,</hi> that Hee should goe to the Indies and there dye à Martyr for Chriſt. I know Malice may Cavil here, And deny all. But Mark what followes. Vpon the Aſſurance of this Prediction Marcellus Himſelfe, the Reuerend Fathers alſo and others relyed, when they ſo Confidently gaue out, That hee should loſe his life at Iapan, and dye à Martyr. Reflect I<note place="margin">The Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reiected. The Miracle proued true.</note> beſeech you. Had it not been in the higheſt meaſure impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, nay more than à foolish Preſumption of thoſe Fathers to haue filled all mens eares with that <hi>Prophetical Speech,</hi> vpon meer future vncertainties? The performance whereof, (all know well) was liable to à thouſand Diſaſters and Caſualities, <hi>in that immenſe voyage from Europe to the furtheſt parts of the world.</hi> Speak impartially. How eaſily Might Marcellus (none of the ſtrongeſt Conſtitutions) haue dyed in the way? What if Pirates had ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on the Ship, and caſt him ouer board? What if the Veſſel had perished by Tempeſt with the virtuous Man, and other Paſſengers? How much ſcorned would the Fathers haue been, who certainly were neuer ſo ſtrangely beſotted as to expoſe themſelues and the reputation of their Order to à publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt vpon meer Contingencies and weak Coniectures. Hence I infer, They had by virtue of S. Xauerius Propheſy à high Moral Aſſurance of the euent, The Propheſy ſpoken ſome years before Marcellus his Martyrdom, was true, And the real Effect of his death proued it true, neither Diuel nor
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:102688:179"/> Mortal man could certainly foretel Things ſo remote, and yet<note place="margin">God wrought the Miracle.</note> to come. God therefore was the Author of that Prediction, And Conſequently His Diuine power by the means of the Saint, wrought the Miracle.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Its high time novv to reaſſume vvhat I began vvith, and ſaid above. When Iewes and Gentils read our ſcriptures which with them may well deſerue as much credit as Humane faith giues to Caeſars Commentaries or any other Hiſtory; When they find in that Sacred book how ſtrangely Chriſtianity was firſt eſtablished, and introduced by the virtue of our Sauiours glorious Wonders. When they fall lower and ſee (though ſtill vpon Humane Faith) an euident Continuance of the very like Miracles wrought in the Roman Catholick Church through euery Age. The Conuiction is by good law ſo ſtrong, the<note place="margin">The Proofs hinted at aboue, vrged</note> Proofs for vndeniable Miracles ſo manifeſt to the dulleſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, that He may as well deny (as Lipſius Saith) the Sun to shine as doubt of thoſe moſt glorious viſible wonders vnque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, in this one Society of Chriſtians. And this hold's true, Although no more but Humane faith reſting on moſt Certain Authority inform's vs of theſe Miracles, For ſuch à Faith, as great Diuines Obſerue, often comes to ſo clear à degree of<note place="margin">The weight of humane Faith.</note> Certitude, that you may well call it an <hi>vndubitable kind of Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I appeal to euery ones Conſcience for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. By all now ſaid vve ſee firſt, that vvhat euer can be propoſed againſt our Churches Miracles, hath like force againſt Chriſt's ovvn glorious works. And I challenge Proteſtants to

For, giue me à naked Church vvithout Signes, without Marks, vvithout Motiues inducing to truth (and the moſt conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Signe of all, is the Glory of Miracles) Nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main's propoſable to à poor Infidel that's meet to conuince his Reaſon, But the bare letter of Scripture, or the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Doctrin of the Church, vvhich ſolely conſidered more affrights weak Reaſon, (naturally auerſe from high Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) than brings it to any Submiſſion or Acquieſcency.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe obiections are as few as fallacious, and cannot be otherwiſe, when, as t'is ſaid, All of them proue as much (that's iuſt nothing) againſt our Sauiours own Miracles as againſt thoſe of the Roman Catholick Church. To ſee this truth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted and difficulties vanish into nothing, be pleaſed to afford à little Attention.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sectary may Obiect firſt. None of vs all know<note place="margin">One obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> what ſtrange effects nature can produce in certain circumſtances, nor what Povver the Diuel has to work Miracles, when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Scripture forwarn's vs. 2. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2. Of Antichriſts great Prodigies, as alſo of Falſe-Chriſts and falſe-Prophets appearing with Signes and wonders. <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. We may iuſtly ſuſpect, if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone cannot doe ſuch works, that the Diuel had à hand in moſt of our Church Miracles. Contra. 1. And You ſee<note place="margin">Found weak and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</note> firſt, the Argument Equally oppugn's Chriſts own Miracles, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenceth both Iewes and Gentils to ſlight him as à falſe-Prophet, and his glorious vvonders alſo. Contra. 2. Not one of theſe Falſe-Prophets once raiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the dead to life, nor after their own death did any thing like à Miracle, as the departed Saints of Gods Church haue done moſt frequently by à touch of their Reliques only, which Truth of (<hi>mighty vveight</hi>) deſerues Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, and refutes what euer Donatiſt, or Coniurer can ſay in behalf of counterfeit Miracles. Contra. 3. And obſerue well
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:102688:181"/> the Obiection. <hi>None knowes what nature or the Diuel can doe &amp;c.</hi> What then I beſeech you? May one inferr from our <hi>not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing</hi> the Diuels power that this euil Spirit hath actually wrought all the Miracles recorded in Scripture, and Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory? To Aſſert this we muſt not only know how farr his power reaches, but more haue Aſſurance alſo Of his actually doing ſuch Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And thus much (manifeſtly improbable) neither is nor can be aſcertained vpon the weakeſt Principle within the compass of nature or grace. We vſually ſay, the Diuel appear's with à Clouen foot, That is, you may eaſily diſcern his Villainy, And we know he neuer caſt's out euil Spirits like Himſelf from poſſeſſed Perſons, which yet hath been done and frequently in God's<note place="margin">Church Miracles aboue the power of Diuels.</note> Church. He can, it is true, if we belieue Hiſtory take vp the Deuided Parts of à dead man and act with them for à while, But there is no ſuch Motion, no ſuch Operations in the dead aſſumed Corps, as haue been ſeen in many Miraculouſly reſtored to life. Be it how you will, We are ſure God can doe, yea and hath done great Miracles, when therefore all imaginable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances forceably induce vs to belieue that they are his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works, it is I hope more wiſdom to Aſcribe them to an Omnipotent Power, than to Father them vpon Diuels.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some who plainly ſee, its à degree of madness to doubt of ſo much humane faith as Teſtifies of Miracles wrought in the Roman Catholick Church grant many haue been done, But then Obiect. 2. God did them to manifeſt that Chriſt is the true Meſſias, or to work à Belief in vs of ſo much Doctrin <hi>only</hi> as is Common to all Chriſtians, but not to confirm our Popish Errours, of <hi>Praying to Saints, Purgatory</hi> &amp;c. Contra. This Argument alſo impugn's our Sauiours great Miracles, which were not wrought (one may ſay) to confirm all the Doctrin he taught, but à Part or parcel of it only. Contra. 2. If Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles Mark out à Doctrin common to all, or confirm ſo much truth And no more; It ſeem's ſtrange, that Arians, Pelagians and Proteſtants work not Miracles as frequently as the Church doth, For theſe men own à Doctrin common to all Chriſtians,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:102688:181"/> yet show none of theſe wonders. Contra. 3. There is not one<note place="margin">Miracles truly alleged for euery Doctrin the Church teaches.</note> Doctrin taught by our Church, (and held erroneous by Sectaries) which is not <hi>Sealed, Signed,</hi> and <hi>Atteſted</hi> by euident Miracles.

Innumerable proue that third place of Purgatory &amp;c. All theſe (may good Authors deſerue Credit) are vpon vndoubted Record. And what iuſt Exception haue Sectaries againſt ſo great Authority? I'le tell you. Their own incredulous Humour. Here is all. Whereas, could they ſpeak to the cauſe, they should giue vs weight for weight, and Oppoſe what we Allege (in behalf of Miracles) vpon grounded Principles. That is, they Should euince poſitiuely that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are meer Cheats, and fain Stories, when we read of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought in confirmation of praying to Saints, the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And this in all law of Diſputation they are obliged to do vpon ſolid Proofs indeed, diſtinct from their own Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, or à <hi>meer Saying, Such Records are falſe.</hi> But do what ye will Sectaries can neuer be driuen to diſpute vpon Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>

To end this point between S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the Donatiſt, as alſo between Catholicks and Proteſtants, I ſay all Controuerſies are fully tried and happily ended by Scripture only. But how? Not becauſe any can pretend to find euery Tenet of Faith clearly ſet down in ſo many express Terms of holy Writ, For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant<note place="margin">How Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture decides all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies.</note> pretend's not to ſo much in behalf of his Doctrin, But thus the Orthodox diſcourſes with <hi>S.

Thus much once clearly laid forth in the written Word, that Holy Book remit's him to the Church Clearly marked, commend's Her, faith <hi>S.

               <p n="8">8. Whence it is, that our profound Doctor Diſputing the Caſe, whether the Baptized by Hereticks were to be rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:102688:183"/> laboured not to decide the Queſtion by any expreſs words in holy Scripture (wholly ſilent in this particular) But contrarywiſe teaches, that the Church which is diffuſed all ouer (and no Party of Donatiſts shut vp in à corner of Afrique) was to giue Sentence herein, For She is that great Oracle, which Scripture commend's. Read <hi>Lib. 2. de Bapt. C.</hi> 4. And <hi>de Vnit: Eccles. C.</hi> 22. Thus briefly you ſee the true difference between the Proteſtant and Catholick, The firſt has not à word of Scripture for his Tenets, much less any Orthodox euidenced Church. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick relies on à Church ſpread the whole world ouer, known by<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks ſtronge hold.</note> Miracles, Conuerſions &amp;c.

We, contrary to the inclination of nature, faſt when Sectaries feaſt; we humbly confeſs our Sins to à Prieſt, they shake of that obligation. Our Church forbid's Marriage to the clergy allowed to Miniſters. We in ſpiritual Affaires ſubmit to one Supreme Head of the Church, They acknowledge no ſubmiſſion to any in points of Belief, but to their own Fancy. We are vnited together in one Ancient Catholick Faith and execrate all Diviſions, They are endleſly deuided in their Nouelties. We ſet à high value vpon the pious laudable works of iuſt men, They eſteem all as ſordid and ſinful. We ſay God inforceth no man to Sin, they as Caluin confeſſes, make him both Author and cauſe of it. I might yet inſtance in à hundred other particulars, But t'is needles. The whole world ſee's that Catholicks, ſtrengthned by the Grace of God, contrary to their intereſt, and natural Propenſions, <hi>euen for conſcience</hi> ſake, Profeſſ and practiſe more Auſterity, Pray more diligently, faſt<note place="margin">Not ſo with Sectaries.</note> oftner, obſerue the lawes of the Church more exactly, And finally doe greater works of Charity than Sectaries either think neceſſary, or hold Themſelues obliged to by virtue of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. I ſay <hi>by vertue of their Religion</hi> which binds to nothing but only to Believe (though no man knowes what) and conſequently giues ſo much liberty in other matters that it makes the Profeſſors thereof Libertins. Moſt vniuſtly therefore doe our new men call Proteſtancy the reformed Religion, (vnleſs by an Antiphraſis or contrary way of ſpeaking) when God knowes, it reforms nothing, but contrariwiſe allowes more then enough relaxation to Corrupted nature. Whence I infer A thing ſo Indulgent as<note place="margin">Proteſtancy miſcalled, à Reformed Religion.</note> Proteſtancy is cannot be from God, who will haue us to curb Senſuallity, and vpon that account the Profeſſors of it ſeem very vnfit to reforme the Doctrin of the Church, were any thing amiſs, whilſt they leaue manners ſo notoriouſly Vnreformed, releaſing all from the burthen of ſuch Duties, as Chriſtians haue practiſed from the Beginning.</p>

                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:102688:190"/>10. Be pleaſed to reflect à little. We haue, thanks be to God, in the Roman Catholick Church many Holy Religious Orders, as <hi>Benedictans, Dominicans, Franciſcans &amp;c.</hi> All had their<note place="margin">The truth declared by two Inſtances</note> ſeueral Founders moſt eminent in Sanctity and neuer medled with mending Church Doctrin, knowing well that was ſound and orthodox, But contrariwiſe endeauored to better the world by their Prayers, Preaching, inceſſant labours, and virtuous Example. Suppoſe now any of theſe had called their Order à reformed Religion and brought Chriſtians by that Reformation to greater Liberty to more Senſuality, than was practiſed before Their Prayers and Preaching; Would not all moſt deſeruedly haue accounted their Labours miſpent and worth nothing? Suppoſe again that any one would begin to Inſtitute à Religious Family, with theſe or the like Iniunctions. All of them may Marry, prouided they keep <hi>Coniugal Chaſtity,</hi> All may faſt but when the humour takes them, All may profeſs Pouerty, but experience no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the hardship. All may obey but in greater matters only, not in others, freely left to their choiſe. Would not ſuch à Founder vainly pretend to Reformation, that laies no more Chriſtian Duties on any? Would not euery man look on him as One that peruerts Religion, and laugh at his folly? This is the caſe in our Proteſtants mending matters. Therefore I ſay once more the Reformation is not from God, but à humane and very ſenſual Inuention. Enough is noted already both here and in the other Treatiſe of the Efficacy of our Catholick Doctrin<note place="margin">Conuerſion of Nations à great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> Demonſtrable to our Eyes and Senſes, in the Conuerſions of Nations to Chriſt. <hi>Maximum Miraculum</hi> Saith <hi>S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thomas 1.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:102688:192"/> And here by the way, we vrge our Nouelliſts, to point at à viſible<note place="margin">Sectaries Vrged to Anſwer.</note> Orthodox Society, which the Suppoſed erring Church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me abandoned, as clearly as we lay forth to them the time, the place, the circumſtances, not only of their own impious Reuolt, But of all other more ancient Hereticks from this Catholick Society. Could the Sectary do thus much, Hee might ſpeak more confidently.</p>
               <p n="15">15. To end the matter now in hand You ſee by what is ſaid already, If Chriſts words haue weight. <hi>Math. 18. 16. In ore duorum vel trium Stet omne verbum;</hi> That Truth ſtand's firm vpon the Teſtimony of two or three vnexceptionable Witneſſess, Wee here introduce two Teſtimonies in behalf of our Church which none can except againſt. <hi>Gods own voice</hi> ſpeaking to reaſon by Miracles and the Motiues now mentioned, is <hi>the One,</hi> And his own ſacred reuealed word, which moſt ſignificantly teaches what theſe Motiues ſpeak, <hi>is the Other.</hi> Hence I ſay Sectaries cannot diſpute againſt this Church, without proofs drawn from Motiues as ſtrong, and Scriptures as clear as are now alleged in our behalf. We preſs them again and again to giue in their Euidence, and ſeriouſly demand whether Proteſtancy was confeſſedly founded by Chriſt, Or, but once owned Orthodox by any ſound Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Sectaries Grauelled at Euery Queſtion.</note> As all acknowledge the foundation of the Roman Catholick and the Orthodoxiſm of it, to haue been eſtablished by Chriſt our Lord. We further enquire after à viſible Succeſſion of their Paſtors, after their viſible Miracles, their viſible Conuerſions, made in foregoing Ages. Nothing is anſwered, nothing is or can be pleaded, nothing in à word is returned probable. Therefore Proteſtancy is an vneuidenced Religion, no Motiues counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the Nouelty, no Scripture ſpeaks for it, and Conſequently cannot but be in the higheſt degree improbable.</p>
               <p n="16">16. A fourth Truth. A Church which weares as it were Gods own Liuery and beares the Signatures of Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Her Miracles, Prodigious Conuerſions &amp;c. ſo far Eclipſes the falſe luſtre of Heathens, Iewes, and Hereticks, that reaſon concludes. <hi>In this one manifeſted Oracle it is,</hi> that Eternal Wiſdom

This iudgement moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, once well ſetled in an vnderſtanding without further debate, ends all controuerſies of Religion.

               <p n="17">17.

The Euidence in both caſes well penetrated ſeem's much à like, call it moral, phyſical or what you pleaſe, whereof more preſently.</p>
               <p n="18">18. From this Diſcourſe it followes, That à Church demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating Gods own <hi>Seal</hi> and manifeſt Caracters of Truth, ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">All walk in Darkness without an Euidenced Church.</note> teaches Truth, that none can rationally contradict Her Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, though often difficult to weak Reaſon. The ground of my Aſſertion is. Renounce once ſuch an Oracle, we are caſt into confuſion, and haue no other Maſter to teach Chriſtians, but the obſcure Myſteries of Faith, (far enough, God knowes, from
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:102688:193"/> any Self-euidence,) and the yet not ſenſed words of holy Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, becauſe the Church which only can, and muſt interpret, is vpon the Suppoſition reiected. In this two fold Darkness of obſcure Myſteries, and vnſenſed Words, weak Reaſon toyls as our Sectaries haue done à whole Age, But with what ſucceſs think ye? S. Peters night labour return's the true Anſwer, <hi>Totá nocte laborantes nihil cepimus,</hi> All night long vve haue took much pains, yet got nothing. Such is the Fate and Folly of our modern Sectaries, that will vvalk in the dark without the Guidance of à Church, And Her infallible Tradition. Here alſo we haue<note place="margin">The true Cauſe of our Sectaries endles Diuiſions.</note> the true cauſe of their endles Diſſentions, and multiplicity of Religions, which almoſt euery year are coyned nevv. All Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits ſaith Mr Thorndicke. <hi>P.</hi> 5. ſo ring of this multiplicity, That novv no Religion ſtand's to be the Religion of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p n="19">19. A fifth Truth. The Sectary that Profeſſeth himſelf à Chriſtian, and ſeriouſly ponder's the Marks, the Signes of Diuine Authority openly ſeen in the Roman Catholick Church, ſtand's ſo conuicted of wilful Errour, that practically he is either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Chriſtianity, or obliged to belieue this euidenced Church, I proue him Firſt conuinced of wilful Errour vpon theſe grounds. The Sectary confeſſeth, or he is no Chriſtian, That this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is efficacious againſt the Iewes. Chriſt our Lord did grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wonders, shewed more manifeſt Miracles, than all other Prophets wrought in the time of Iudaiſm, and from hence He inferrs, or (shall neuer proue it) that Chriſt is the true Meſſias. Therefore this Argument is equally preſſing againſt Proteſtants.<note place="margin">What euer Argument Proues Chriſt to bee the true Moſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Whereas Contrarywiſe this naked Proteſtancy, has no reſemblance of à Church, But lies in Obſcurity, vneuidenced, only known by its own Monſtru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:102688:193"/> firy vpon this Account, That two hideous Rebells begot it in Pride, and brought it forth in Diuiſion to no other purpoſe, but to fright all that look on it. Again the Sectary, if he be Chriſtian, muſt hold this Argument Valid againſt the Iewes. All the Propheſies in Scripture ſpeaking of the true Meſſias, exactly agree to, and were amply fulfilled, in the Perſon of Chriſt our Sauiour, and in no other. But the like Argument hold's as ſtrongly in our caſe. For all the Ancient Propheſies of the true Chriſtian Church whereof we read in the old Teſtament, As of Her <hi>Continuance, Viſibility,</hi> and Nations flocking to Her only agree, and are exactly fulfilled in the Roman Catholick Church, And not ſo much as one appeares in this naked Nouelty of Proteſtancy, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Roman Catholick Church and not that Fatherles Progeny of Proteſtants, is the only true Catholick Oracle of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Laſtly this Argument is ſtronge againſt the Iewes and Proues them deſerted by Almighty God. Since Chriſt came to Redeeme vs, This abandoned people lie vnder contempt, and are<note place="margin">A viſible Mark of Gods wrath. Set vpon Ievves and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> beſt known vpon the Account of their open iniuſtice, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to ſet à viſible Mark of his wrath vpon them, has not only ſcattered them vp and down ſome few corners of the world, but alſo permitted them to Deuide and Subdiuide into ſeueral Sects, and Factions. But the ſame Argument is as forceable againſt Proteſtants, For firſt, the whole Chriſtian world abroad ſlights the men as <hi>Innouators,</hi> and their Doctrin alſo as <hi>Nouelties. Arians, Semiarians, Graecians, Abyſsins</hi> deteſt Proteſtancy, and as highly contemn the Authors of it, as the far extended Church of Rome condemn's both the one, and other.</p>
               <p n="21">21. 2. No Iniuſtice euer done by Iew, except that one wicked fact of crucifying Chriſt our Lord, is comparable to the open<note place="margin">The open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice of Protestants.</note> clamorous wronge of Proteſtants, who without law or right yea contrary to all conſcience, violently vſurpe the Eccleſiaſtical goods in England, and worſe than Robbers on the high way appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate all to Them ſelues, which neither God nor man intended for them. Theſe Reueneues were giuen by Catholicks for the Orthodox Paſtors and Teachers of our Ancient Religion, that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:102688:194"/> lawfully and quietly poſſeſſed them for à thouſand years, And now behold à Robbery done but one age ſince, turn's the true Owners out à doores, And ſerues, forſooth, to intail Church Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings vpon Luthers Progeny, open Rebels againſt the Church. The world neuer heard of greater Iniuſtlce.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Now laſtly if we ſpeak of different Sects, and endles Diuiſions in points of Doctrin, Moſt vndoubtedly the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are greater, the Sects more numerous amongſt Proteſtants profeſſing Chriſtianity, than among the very Iewes that profeſs. Iudaiſm. A iuſt iudgement of God, A clear Mark of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſet vpon both. The Sin of the one for deſerting Chriſt,<note place="margin">Diuiſions more amongſt ſectaries then Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes.</note> hath ſcattered that People vp and down the world, And the Sin of Sectaries, for their deſerting an Ancient Church, hath more ſcattered and diuided them into endles erroneous, and moſt iar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring opinions. Vpon theſe grounds therefore, That Proteſtants belieue not an Oracle ſigned with the Marks of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; That they reiect à Church clearly Propheſied of in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly VVrit, That they lie hid in vneuidenced Conuenticles, And broach Doctrins ſlighted the whole world ouer; That their open iniuſtice and robbery cryes to heauen for reuenge, <hi>Practically</hi> I ſay, They renounce Chriſt, Church and all Chriſtianity with it.

Theſe Miracles, far aboue the Power of nature, were Gods own works, and manifeſtly teſtifyed that none ſince the world began, whether Heathen, Iew, or Heretick, euer paralleld Chriſt our Lord in the like VVonders.

Then the Heathen, if rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and deſirous to learn Truth, muſt confeſs that God ſpeaks Truth by this one Catholick Oracle only, Or there is no ſuch thing as à reuealed Verity taught in the world.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Out of what is ſaid already I infer firſt. If that Maxim of Philoſophy he vndoubted, <hi>Frustra ſit per plura</hi> &amp;c. It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to multiply many proofs in behalf of à Verity, when one moſt clearly conuinceth it.

I ſay in à General way.</hi> For as the viſible works in nature, proue this General Truth. <hi>Ipſe fecit nos</hi> &amp;c. A mighty power made vs, we made<note place="margin">The efficacy of Church Motiues.</note> not our Selues, though as yet none comes thereby to an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit knowledge of many Perfections in God; So the Marks and Motiues manifeſt in the Church, conuince this General Truth
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:102688:199"/> alſo. That the ſame Power which made Nature giues being to theſe, the ſame Power which preſerues nature, preſerues theſe glorious Signes for our inſtruction, And Conſequently it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, That as the viſible world is proued Gods own work, ſo this viſible glorious marked Church is proued his own Oracle, Though yet neither the Heathen nor any knowes euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doctrin, which God teaches by the Church. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner great Diuines aſſert, that Chriſts own Diſciples owned firſt our bleſſed Lord as the true Meſſias, and à great Prophet. <hi>Ioan. 1. 41.

               <p n="17">17. A ſecond Inference. The General Truth now ſpoken of well eſtablished. <hi>God teaches the world by à Church</hi> Signed with Supernatural wonders, All further diſputes ceaſe concerning the particular Doctrins She teaches, though ſublime and aboue the reach of our weak Capacities. For none, whether Heathen, Iew, or Heretick, can boggle at à Doctrin which God reueal's,<note place="margin">How reaſon diſcourſes vpon theſe Euident Motiues.</note> But God, ſaith prudent Reaſon, reueal's ſuch and ſuch Truths, <hi>The Incarnation of the Diuine word,</hi> the <hi>Trinity, Original ſin</hi> &amp;c. by à Church which moſt preſſing Motiues euince to be His own Oracle, Therefore it is my duty to Submit and belieue euery Doctrin She propoſes.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The Ground hereof ſeem's clear. For as there can be no endles Progreſs or going on in <hi>Infinitum</hi> in the intrinſecal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Obiect of Faith, becauſe Faith at laſt reſt's vpon one ſure Principle, An <hi>infinite Verity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> So we can haue no endles Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the extrinſick Lights, and Motiues, whereby we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to fix à firm Belief vpon that one <hi>ſure Principle.</hi> Therefore in what euer Society of men Reaſon finds theſe Motiues, it reſt's, without further Enquiry after ſtronger, which cannot be found, But moſt euidently reaſon finds them in one only Oracle the Roman Catholick Church (as is now proued) and prudently
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:102688:200"/> reſteth there as vpon lights which <hi>immediatly</hi> manifeſt the Church,<note place="margin">Scripture not ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the Church.</note> and make Her Doctrin euidently credible. Scripture, t'is true, is the obiect of Faith, but not ſo immediatly credible as the Church, for independently of Scripture, I can belieue the Church as the firſt Chriſtians did before the Book was written, but men generally in this preſent State cannot belieue Scripture without the Churches Teſtimony, As is already, and shall hereafter be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued more at large.</p>
               <p n="19">19. A third Inference. Who euer pretend's to à Doctrin reuealed in Scripture and hold's it of Faith, has either à Church which teaches it euidenced by the Marks of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, or He publisheth à falshood.

His procedure is iuſt like à man vnſkilful in Muſick, that hearing one Note alone which ſeem's harsh, ſlights all without more Adoe, whereas he should liſten to the whole Harmony before he iudges.

               <p n="3">3. A ſecond Propoſition.

That if God be an intellectual Being infinitly wiſe, his thoughts are as far aboue our thoughts as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens aboue earth, And therefore aduentures deſperatly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect Prouidence which his shallow head neither doth, nor can Vnderſtand. Finally He neuer reflect's, that to deny all diuine Foreſight caſt's Reaſon into more Mazes, than to grant it; For deny it, we muſt ſay, That this admirable and well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red work of nature Gouern's it ſelf. The Sun, Moon, and Starrs, moue themſelues. We muſt ſay, That the vaſt and ſwift cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation<note place="margin">What they are forced to grant againſt Reaſon.</note> of theſe Celeſtial Bodies depend on no Superiour cauſe; vnleſs we faine many vnknown inuiſible Gods, or Genii, <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of themſelues,</hi> And ſay Theſe run about with the Heauens, and regulate that admirable Motion. But to Aſſert this without Proof offer's more violence to our intellectual Faculties than to own one powerful Being, eſſentially wiſe, and therefore <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant</hi> ouer all Hee Gouern's. In à word you ſee here, this great Fabrick of Nature (ſome rightly compare it to à Clock or Watch)

Men comply not with their Duty but abuſe their own Free will, Therefore God is blameable becauſe he either makes them not meer Animals, Brutish, or forces not Virtue vpon them againſt their wills.

That God, after ſo many menacings ſo much Terrour laid before vs if we transgreſs, leaues liberty to its own free choiſe, and will ſeuerely punish the Offenders; But that Spurious Progeny of euil Works he own's not.

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:102688:203"/> might vapour more boldly; But hereof there is no danger, for nature it ſelf leaues this deep impreſſion in all (let who will Gouern it) that one ſupreme Regent hates Iniquity, and that as he often doth viſibly in this life, So he will more rigidly take Reuenge in the future. <hi>Mihi vindicta: &amp; Ego retribuam.

And this conſideration alone of both preſent (moſt clear) and future Punishments, ſo blunt's and dead's the Atheiſts Plea, that their beſt Arguments fall to nothing, and are indeed reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into pure Non-ſenſe. This conſideration alone, that God will reward the vniuſt ſufferings of the Virtuous, is comfort enough for them, and euery rational prudent Creature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We are next to diſpatch the main buſineſs with theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, who deſire to haue as ſtrong Proofs in behalf of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, as they allege againſt it. I will therefore for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Satisfaction of all, produce three moſt conuincing Arguments. One is; The Deity we all Adore is not inexorable, but, as clear and manifeſt Experience teaches, and moſt known Hiſtory in<note place="margin">One clear proof of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.</note> all Ages relates, hear's often the Prayers of iuſt men in time of Tribulation releaſing them from ſudden danger, when no huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Power can help in the Exigency, Innumerable after earneſt Prayer and hands lifted vp to Heauen, haue found ſpeedy Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, ſome in the peril of Shipwrak eſcaped, others thrown to hungry lions haue been leſt vntouched, others caſt into rhe fire not ſo much as ſcorched, volumes might be writ of ſuch particulars. Therefore there is à Supreme Numen, that has care of vs, the Sun, Moon, and Starrs hear not, nor can lend ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in ſuch preſſing Neceſſities, And to recurr to no man knowes what inviſible Spirits, is, as we now ſaid, leſs intelligible and far more difficult, than to own one powerful Being of Himſelf that both can and doth relieue at his good Pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="6">6. 2. The knowledge of future things Sublime, and aboue the reach of all Creatures, Argues à Power Omniſcient, and Omnipotent. The reaſon is. The Prenotion of what's to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, not yet limited to any Being in it ſelfe, nor as yet deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately exiſting, neceſſarily ariſes from an Infinite Knowledge
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:102688:204"/> and efficacy of light, which extends it Selfe to what euer can be<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things proues à Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient.</note> known; for that power which comprehend's things future, much more comprehend's all paſt and preſent, and therefore has an infinit Extent, which we call <hi>Omniſcience.</hi> Now I ſubſume. But an Intellectual power is in being, that by virtue <hi>of his own light knowes future</hi> Truths wherof none can doubt, becauſe he has actually communicated part of his knowledge to others, For example, to the Ancient Prophets, who moſt exactly fortold things to come relating to Chriſt our Lord, and the Glory of his Church; Such Secrets highly Diuine, they had not as men nor were they known by any Principle within the bounds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore God <hi>Omniſcient</hi> imparted all; And he did ſo not in vain, but for this great End, That mortals may ſee how an infinit Goodneſs condeſcend's to inform vs of Truths whereby he manifeſtly tender's our Happineſs, And this alone demonſtrat's Prouidence. That the Prophets foretold truths to come is euident by the books of Scripture, writ whole ages before they happened, and the Euent viſible to our eyes, proues the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Predictions. What haue your Aſtronomers who more often miſs then hit in their Predictions comparable to theſe Propheſies in Scripture? Nothing at all, if (which deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues reflection) we conſider the <hi>Eminency,</hi> the <hi>Depth,</hi> and high <hi>importance</hi> of the Myſteries reuealed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. My laſt proof taken from one Manifeſt Abſurdity, is no leſs than demonſtratiue. Suppoſe Prouidence be denyed, it followes, That thoſe Millions of men who ſince the worlds Creation adored God, whereof innumerable were wiſe, vpright, and holy, haue all been beſotted and ſtupidly beguiled in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring that which is not. Nay more, This alſo is conſequent,<note place="margin">A third and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing Proof.</note> That à few abiect, ignorant, and deſpicable Atheiſts, are only indowed with the light of à Truth, which once eſtablished, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes Virtue odious, Honeſty, and Goodnes highly contemptible.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the conſequence. If Prouidence be à chimera, All our acts of Reuerence, of Fear, Obedience, Religion and Gratitude ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to God, eſſentially bleſſed with that fore-ſeing Power
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:102688:204"/> are diſſonant to reaſon, and in themſelues abominably ſinful. Contrarywiſe, All acts of Contumely, of Blaſphemy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Prouidence, are conſonant to reaſon, and moſt lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. The more therefore, we blaſpheme, contemn Diuine Prouidence, the more laudably we operate, and as highly merit praiſe, as one doth that contemn's an Idol ſet beſore him to worship. For Prouidence, Say Atheiſts, is an Idol, Ergo to adore it is madneſs, to contemn it, moſt Praiſe worthy.

And thus much briefly of reaſonable Arguments in behalf of Prouiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, to oppoſe that ſlight Plea of Atheiſtical Spirits already Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and diſſolued.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The third Propoſition. As Atheiſts plead fallaciouſly againſt Prouidence, ſo Heathens Iewes, and Hereticks follow cloſely the like Strain in euery Argument propoſed againſt the Myſteries of Faith taught by Chriſt and his Church.<note place="margin">Atheiſts and Heretiques argue à like.</note> I would ſay. As the Atheiſt run's headlong with his weak Iudgement vpon Difficulties, ſo theſe now named, erre as he erreth. They make <hi>Direct Reaſon</hi> to ſee more than it can ſee, to Comprehend Myſteries incomprehenſible, and quite caſt aſſide that Prudent reflex Reaſon, which allayes all, and giues moſt Satisfaction. For example, The Heathen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend's not that great Myſtery of the Trinity, and there ſtand's puzzled. Good cauſe, ſay I, for if à Cockle shell contain's not the whole Occan; why should thy shallow head comprehend the Trinity? Were this poſſible, either thou muſt be God, or God leaue of to be what he is. The Iew vnderſtand's not how God became man, and dyed igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniouſly vpon à Croſs. Obſerue à ſtrange Stupidity ſaith Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely S. Chriſoſtom. <hi>Lib. Quod Chriſtus ſit Deus,</hi> towards the end. Theſe Aduerſaries of Chriſt read of contempt and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and credit all. They read in the ſame Scripture of our Sauiours <hi>Admirable Miracles</hi> and belieue nothing. Here is want
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:102688:205"/> of Reflex Reaſon. The Heretick boggles at the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation, and wonders that à Church made vp of fallible men can be held infallible. And from whence comes<note place="margin">The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proued.</note> this boggling? What cauſe is there of wonder? He Anſwer's. Tranſubſtantiation ſeems contrary to Senſe and Reaſon. Very good. I Ask again, to what Reaſon is it oppoſit? Grant gratis the Vtmoſt, it only ſeem's contrary to that not wel-ſighted Reaſon which more often beguils than learns vs Truth, or which loſeth it ſelf in the Search of deep Myſteries, where it can find no <hi>Exil.</hi> But Anſwer I beſeech you? Is the Doctrin op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that Other wiſe Prudent iudgement, whereby all know or should know, <hi>That reaſon is neuer more reaſonable, than when</hi>
                  <note place="margin">When Reaſon is reaſonable?</note> 
                  <hi>it leaues off reaſoning in high matters aboue reaſon?</hi> No certainly For deny once this one clear Chriſtian Principle, or ſay that's only belieuable and no more, which weak reaſon Approues; We deſtroy the very Eſſence of Faith and can belieue nothing. The Doctrin of Gods <hi>Free-acts,</hi> of à <hi>Trinity,</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> of Tranſubſtantiation, and the other like Myſteries is quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, if ſo much only gain's belief, as weak reaſon (puzzled in the Myſteries) ſee's Reaſon for.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I ſay therefore. This Direct <hi>purblind reaſon</hi> caſt's vs vpon Difficulties, <hi>Reflex reaſon</hi> ſolues them. The firſt makes vs meer<note place="margin">What effects weak reaſon produces.</note> Scepticks yea (and followed) Atheiſts too, The ſecond good Chriſtians: The Firſt remains in darkneſs, the ſecond finds light. The firſt would turn all faith into Science, the ſecond ſaith, No, <hi>Si non credideritis non intelligetis.</hi> Vnleſs you belieue you shall not vnderſtand. The firſt, though no more but à handmaid, would rule, bear ſway, and command, the ſecond curb's that petulancy, and bids Her Obey. Now the only difficulty is to show what is meant by Prudent-<hi>reflex Reaſon,</hi> and of what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it is in matters of Faith.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Briefly this reaſon ſtands not long vpon the Myſteries<note place="margin">How the reflex and prudent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon proceed's.</note> reuealed but, leaues off that loſt labour and relies wholly, on the Authority of one Maſter, that reueals them. Hence <hi>Clem. Rom. in Recogn. D. Petri</hi> giues this wiſe counſel. <hi>Ante Omnia,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:102688:205"/> Before all things examin well by rational Motiues, whether he be à Prophet that ſpeaks; This done, ponder no more but belieue boldly all he Saith. And wonder nothing at the principle, for it is far more eaſy to find out the Prophet by his marks, and ſignes, than to vnderſtand the ſublime Doctrin he teaches. S. Irenaeus! <hi>Lib. 9. C.</hi> 9. 1. ſpeakes conformably. <hi>Non enim nos aliter diſcere poteramus quae ſunt Dei, niſi Magister noſter verbum exiſtens homo factus fuiſſet.</hi> We could not otherwiſe learn thoſe Secrets God has reuealed, vnleſs our great Maſter, the Diuine word, had been made man. Which is to ſay, the Reaſon we call reflex and prudent, moſt eaſily finds out the Maſter that teaches truth, and hauing once found him it relies on his word, whilſt direct Reaſon ſtayes intangled in difficult Myſteries, and learns nothing. Hence alſo it is, that S. Thomas and others moſt profoundly. Obſerue à notable difference, in our proceeding when we harken to God, and to man. When we treat with man, we rigidly<note place="margin">What man ſpeak's is to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what God ſaith, not.</note> examin the things he ſpeak's, and if found abſurd, or impoſſible, reiect them; We obſerue the coherence of his Diſcourſe, and iudge whether it be conſonant, or diſſonant to reaſon. But to proceed thus with God, who can neither deceiue, nor be deceiued, is Impudence; Enquire then no more but thus much only, what God ſaies, and reſt Satisfied, his own ſole word, is warrant enough.</p>
               <p n="11">11. We come now to apply this Doctrin more home. The Primitiue Chriſtians, after à prudent ſearch, found out by euident ſignes, and wonders, the great Maſter of the world Chriſt our Lord, and were commanded to hear him <hi>Matth. 17. 5. Ipſum audite.</hi> And becauſe he proued Himſelf by manifeſt fignes, to be à Doctor and Prophet ſent from. God, They belieued the Doctrin he taught, <hi>vpon his own word,</hi> though very ſublime and aboue weak reaſon. Now here is à Point of conſequence worth our ſerious ponderation.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Can any one imagin, that our great Doctor of truth<note place="margin">An applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Doctrin.</note> left vs all comfortles, or ſo deſtitute in his Abſence, without Paſtors without Prophets, withous liuing Oracles that yet ſpeak
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:102688:206"/> in his name, and deliuer with all certainty thoſe Verities he taught, and will haue euer taught? Reflect I beſeeck you. This great Maſter ſaith No. <hi>Iohn. 20. 16. As my Father ſent me, ſo I ſend you. Matth. 20. 19. Goe and teach all Nations. Luke. 10. 16. He that hear's you hears me.</hi> And to theſe Paſtors he promiſes <hi>his preſence and continual aſsiſtance to the end of Ages. Matt.</hi> 28. 20. I will be with you euer to the end of the world. And the<note place="margin">There is yet à teaching Oracle.</note> very excellency, the very nature, of Diuine Learning requires this Aſſiſtance, and muſt, if Diuine, depend on an Oracle which cannot but ſpeak in Gods name Truth, and Truth only. For how is it poſſible to conceiue the vaſt moral Body of Chriſtians, of ſo different tempers diffuſed the whole world ouer, knit firmly together in one ſauing Faith; if no certain Oracle laies forth that learning, which God has reuealed, and will haue all to belieue.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The Sectary may Anſwer, Scripture is his Oracle, he needs no more. Contra. 1. Chriſtianity had à liuing Oracle before Scripture was written, did then that Oracle ceaſe to be becauſe Gods truths were committed to paper or parchment? Contra 2. And mark I beſeech you, how vnwarily weak reaſon (already reiected) works miſchief to it ſelf, and others. Reaſon<note place="margin">The Plea of Sectaries reiected.</note> reads Scripture, and when that is done, it ſett's endles iarrs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſable debates not only between man and man, but, which is worſe, between God and man; Therefore Scripture thus handled can be no Oracle that vnites all in one Faith. Theſes Iarrs between man and man are manifeſt, for the Arians, Pelagians, Proteſtants, and Catholicks read the book, and you ſee what fighting there is about the Senſe, which only indeed (and not the bare letter) is Scripture. Now that ſome of theſe many Contend alſo with God, is vndeniable. For God approues not all theſe different ſenſes becauſe contradictory, Therefore ſome draw à falſe meaning from Scripture, and theſe <hi>Some</hi> (let the fault light yet where you will) oppoſe the true Senſe of the Holy Ghoſt, yea act ſtifly to their Eternal shame, againſt that noble perfection in God, his vndeceiued Verity and this I call contention or quarrelling with
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:102688:206"/> God (Truth it ſelf) which as you ſee, our Sectaries will haue goe on without redreſs, becauſe they allow of no Doctor no Teacher, no Oracle, that can end the Strife, or reduce the erring Party to due ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I ſay therefore, And here is my laſt Propoſition. The<note place="margin">The true teaching Oracle name'd.</note> Roman Catholick Church, which prudent reaſon eaſrly find's out, and no other Society of Chriſtians, is Gods own Oracle, What she teaches, we learn; what she reiect's, we reiect, Her Definitiue word is our warrant, without further dubious ſearch made into the Myſteries propoſed. The proof of my Aſſertion, depend's on this brief diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="15">15. God obliges all poor and rich, learned, and vnlearned, to embrace true Religion, And conſequently afford's means to find it out, being à matter of ſo much weight as concerns Saluation, But the Neceſſary means to find true Religion, is to come to the knowledye of that Oracle which Propoſes and teaches truth with all certainty, For no man teaches Himſelf but learns, if wiſe, of à better Maſter; Scripture you ſee Ends not our Controuerſies. The Myſteries of Faith are not our Doctors, becauſe theſe in themſelues obſcure, are belieued after Reaſon has found out Gods liuing Oracle, Therefore all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians muſt own à Teacher, an Oracle of truth eſtablished by Almighty God, commiſſioned to enlighten and to inſtruct the world. <hi>How shall they hear</hi> ſaith S. Paul Rom. 10. 15. without <hi>à Preacher.</hi> Obſerue well à teaching Oracle is to Propoſe Euangelical Doctrin. <hi>But how shall they preach vnleſs they they be</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Church Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to teach, inſtruct's all.</note> 
                  <hi>ſent?</hi> Here you ſee the Miſſion and commiſſion of Euangelical Doctors plainly pointed at. Now further. As none can but own ſuch an Oracle, ſo all muſt likewiſe acknowledge it ſo Viſible by Marks and Signes, ſo obuious to ſenſe and prudent reaſon, that the moſt ſimple may diſcern it from Heretical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities; For this Oracle teaches the pooreſt ſort of men, therefore Prouidence has made the euidence thereof plain, and ſuitable to the meaneſt capacities.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Here we See again the difference, between the eſſential
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:102688:207"/> Doctrin of the Church, and the Churches outward luſtre manifeſt in Her Signes. The firſt is not got by long Pauſing vpon the Myſteries of Faith, nor by rigidly examining the things reuealed, as we diſcuſs Doctrins probable or improbable in Schools. No. The Chriſtian ſaith not, I will either <hi>Know</hi> how God can be one Eſſence and three diſtinct Perſons, How the Incarnation is poſſible, or I will belieue neither; For goe this way to work, he doth like one that takes wholſom Pills and chewes them, but finding much bitternes, ſoon ſpits them out. Thus then he should proceed guided by à Reflex prudent diſcourſe. My only ſearch is to find out that Oracle whereby God ſpeaks to Heathens, Iewes, Chriſtians and Hereticks; There is ſuch an one manifeſted, or none can Belieue any thing. This once found,<note place="margin">How pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reaſon diſcourſes.</note> I examin no more, nor intricate my ſelf in the Myſteries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but will humbly Submit to all that's taught. This wiſdom I learn from the Primitiue Chriſtians, who moſt eaſily knew that Chriſt our Lord was the true Meſſias, and one ſent from God by the Wonders he wrought, though they little yet vnderſtood the depth of thoſe Myſteries he deliuered, and obliged all to belieue. Thus much Premiſed.</p>
               <p n="17">17. I Proue that the Roman Catholick Church is God's only Oracle. And firſt Her exteriour Marks and ſigns giue in as clear euidence of Her being the only Diuine Oracle, as the wonders which the Apoſtles wrought euidenced them to be Diuine Oracles. With this luſtre we haue à Church moſt viſible, and diſcernable, from all vnorthodox Communities. None can Parallel Her in known Miracles, in Antiquity, Perpetuity, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions &amp;c. 2. This Church hath taught the world euer ſince<note place="margin">The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches clear Euidence.</note> Chriſtianity began, and no Orthodox Society but She only is nameable, which deliuered the Sincere Doctrin of Chriſt; For hint at any, they are manifeſtly proued condemned Hereticks. 3. She was neuer cenſured in any Age of errour by ſo much as one confeſſed ſound Chriſtian, Nay I ſay more (and haue proued it aboue) She is ſo infallible, that if she erred but in one Article, She then ceaſed to be Gods Oracle. 4. This Church
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:102688:207"/> ſhowes the Miſſion of Her Paſtors, and deriues Her Comiſſion to teach the world, from God, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The firſt Miſſion concerning the teaching of the new Teſtament Originally came from Almighty God, that ſent his only Son our Sauiour to preach. <hi>Iohn. 14. 24. The word you haue heard is not mine but his that ſent me, the Fathers. Luke 4. 14. He ſent me to Euangelize to the poor.</hi> Now Chriſt our Lord, ſent the other Apoſtles. <hi>Mark 16. 15. Going into the whole world preach the Goſpel to all creatures.</hi> Theſe firſt Maſters, had their Succeſſors lawfully commiſſioned, they ſent others age after age, in ſo much that the Miſſion of Orthodox Paſtors legally authorized to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Sacraments, and to preach Gods word, neuer yet failed in the Roman Catholick Church ſince Chriſt's being vpon earth, nor shall fail hereafter to the worlds end.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Theſe Truths well weighed, And after many ſerious thoughts found as they are vndeniable, Prudent reaſon account's all that can be obiected againſt our euidenced Church, worſe than folly. And here is the ground <hi>à Priori</hi> of the folly. Theſe Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries<note place="margin">Sectaries miſtake the right way of arguing.</note> that Oppoſe vs, quite miſtake the right way of Arguing, (were there any) For, whereas they should firſt find out Gods great Oracle which teaches truth, and obiect that againſt vs, They wholly waue this matter of higheſt Importance, And, ſo far as weak Reaſon can work, draw Arguments from the dark Myſteries of Faith. One finds difficulty in the Trinity and reiect's it, Another in the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation and hold's it impoſſible. That is, weak reaſon, as much ſet's vp its own light againſt God, as if one should offer to extinguiſh the Sun beams by the dim light of à candle.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Obſerue I beſeech you à ſtrange Procedure. We eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence à Church; we proue Her Gods Oracle by the Characters, Signes and Marks manifeſtly laid open to all mens eyes, we ſay this manifeſted Oracle which has drawn Millions of ſouls to the Catholick belief cannot beguile vs. Our Aduerſaries one the other ſide Say (notwithſtanding this reaſonable Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce) God ſpeaks not by Her, <hi>Becauſe the Myſteries are hard</hi> and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:102688:208"/> Reaſon; whereas indeed the quite Contrary should be inferred,<note place="margin">They plead moſt ſimply.</note> viz. Becauſe they are myſterious God ſpeaks by ſo euidenced an Oracle. And here is the Reaſon of my Inference.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Had the abſtruſe Myſteries taught by the Church been à humane Inuention only, and not from God, the ſuppoſed Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of them (who euer he was) had been worſe then mad to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo many, to our shallow Reaſon. He should rather haue followed the ſtrain of all other Hereticks, and with the Arians denyed à Trinity, with Proteſtants caſt of Tranſubſtantiation,<note place="margin">The reaſon of their weak plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> But this you ſee is not done, The Church ſpeak's truth plainly, becauſe She knowes there is an other light, à ſtronger Euidence which leſſens, facilitates, and conquer's theſe ſeeming Difficulties. If therefore there be euidence enough of Credibility for this one Propoſition. <hi>God ſpeaks to all by this known Oracle,</hi> Reaſon pleads no more, but yeilds to one that cannot erre.</p>
               <p n="22">22. It may perhaps appear Strange, if One conſider with what plain Simplicity the Holy Euangeliſts wrote the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt, where they ſeem to furnish the Iewes with Arguments againſt our Sauiour. They declared how He was contemned, reproached, Scourged, haled from Tribunal to Tribunal, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Crucified. Here the Aduerſaries of Chriſt Exclaim, and Ask what's more Difficult? Could God poſſibly (Say they)<note place="margin">The Candor of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours life.</note> permit his only ſon to be thus abuſed, when 'tis writ, <hi>Maledic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus qui pendit in ligno.</hi> Curſed is the man that hang's on à Croſs? The Euangeliſts feared not the Obiection, but, related the Story as it was. Nor did they to gain their great Maſter applauſe Couer or diſſemble his Sufferings as Policy might haue done, had humane Wiſdom only made the Book. No. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded candidly; And why all this Sincerity think ye? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is eaſy. They knew well, that the Victory which our Sauiour gained after all theſe ſufferings, The Renown he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon the Cross, the Miracles he then and formerly had wrought, were ſo forceable Euidences of his being the true Meſſias, that no contrary Humiliation, euen to death it ſelf, could obſcure that greater light and rational euidence of Truth. Therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

                  <head>Arguments drawn from what is ſaid. Reflections made vpon the premiſed Doctrin.</head>

                     <note place="margin">Chriſt, and His Church preuaile againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity.</note>23. Hence I Argue. If the euident Light of our Sauiours glorious Miracles was ſufficient to vanquish Incredulity, and to work à Belief in all of his truely being the Son of God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the difficulty of the Myſtery; It followes clearly that the vndeniable Euidence of the Roman Catholick Church already laid forth, is as fully ſufficient to vanquish the Incredulity of <hi>Heathens, Iewes</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> And to work this Perſwaſion in all (notwithſtanding the high Myſteries propoſed) that She is Gods Oracle. For here is my Principle, and moſt vndoubted. That as the Verity of Chriſtian Religion is to be learned from that known Oracle which bear's Chriſt's Enſigns, without diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sublimity of the Doctrin, ſo the falſity of à Doctrin is proued, (Not by the difficulty thereof), but, is clearly gathered, from the Nullity of an vneuidenced Church, which teaches it. An vneuidenced Church therefore is no warrant of true Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And here you haue briefly the fundamental Reaſon, why no Heretick, can probably oppoſe the receiued Doctrin of our Catholick Oracle, or defend his own contrary to it, whilſt he is Churchless, I mean ſo long as he giues in no Euidence<note place="margin">The true reaſon why no Heretick can oppoſe the Church.</note> of an other Church diſtinct from the Roman Catholick, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, as vniuerſal as She is, as glorious in Miracles as She is, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Conuerſions as She is, as Vncenſured as She is, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:102688:209"/> to preach, and teach the world, as She is, I ſay whils't no ſuch qualified Church can be euidenced, which contradicted our preſent Catholick Doctrin, and maintained that of Sectaries, ſo long the Proteſtant cannot defend his own opinions, nor ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally oppoſe our Catholick Tenents. For here, as S. Auſtin anciently obſerued diſputing with the Donatiſts, lies the main Buſineſs and it decides all Difficulties. <hi>Vtrum veſtra, an noſtra ſit Eccleſia Dei.</hi> Whether yours, or ours, be the Church of God. Let then this one point, worthy Debate, be rigidly examined; And 'tis eaſily done may the euer acknowledged Marks, and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, of the true Church haue weight with Prudent reaſon, We are all without more Diſpute reunited in one Ancient Faith.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And who can (if his cauſe be good) decline this modeſt Offer? When t'is known, that theſe publick Signs haue fix'd,<note place="margin">Sectaries Euer decline the Sentence of an Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced Church</note> and eſtablished this publick Iudgement in all through the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world.

But Sectaries in all their Polemicks waue this worthy Queſtion concerning an euidenced Church, and vnworthily to the great Weariſomnes of euery Reader, ſtand pitifully trifling with à few long ſince defeated and worn-out Controuerſies. <hi>I ſay trifling,</hi> For is it not more then ſlight and friuolous, now to flurt at the worſhiping of Images, now to pelt the Pope, now to quote à half ſenſed Sentence againſt Purgatory, now to miſrelate<note place="margin">And trifle time away.</note> à Story, now if à wickednes lie in à Corner to rifle that, Now to talk, as if men were mad, of the Roman Churches Idolatry. Here to iibe at our Ceremonies, there to attaint the Spotles Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts Spouſe? Say for Gods ſake to what purpoſe is this? when the Knowledge of that <hi>Vnum neceſſarium</hi> which cannot but be known. viz. <hi>Here is Gods euidenced Oracle</hi> ſo clearly ends all Debates, ſo iuſtly determin's what's true, and what's falſe, in theſe and the like particulars, that none can, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe led on with à Spirit of Contradiction withſtand the iuſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of this One euidenced Oracle.</p>

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:102688:209"/> many things She teaches appear doubtful to him. I haue Anſwered. <hi>Diſc. 1. C.</hi> 18.

That rhe Roman Catholick Church only, Euidently shewes theſe Signs, and by Virtue of them demonſtrat's Her ſelf to be Gods own Oracle. Here you haue my Principles already laid forth, And à Petition with them to Proteſtants, to infringe or weaken but One of them, vpon Scripture-Proof, vpon the irrefragable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Fathers, or by Virtue of any Principle which may appear probable to the vniuerſal Senſe, or rational Conſent of ſuch as haue been owned Orthodox ſince Chriſt liued on earth. But to do this is vtterly impoſſible.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Deſcend now if you pleaſe to particular Controuerſies, you shall euer find that nothing but the twilight of weak Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, meer Doubtfulness I mean, ſupport's Proteſtant Religion. It is doubtful ſay theſe Aduerſaries, whether Purgatory be, or<note place="margin">Doubts and Cauils are the only Support of Protestancy.</note> no. It is doubtful whether Praying to Saints be Orthodox Doctrin. The Popes Supremacy ouer the whole Church is Doubtful, and Queſtionable. Very Good, let theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions paſs yet as doubtful. <hi>Perhaps Purgatory is not, Perhaps it is. Perhaps inuocation of Saints</hi> is Orthodox Doctrin, Perhaps no, For neither the one, nor other conſidered in Themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves is à Truth Euident <hi>Ex terminis,</hi> or ſo much as Morally certain. Now here is the iuſt Trial. The Proteſtant poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely <hi>denyes Purgatory.</hi> I poſitiuely <hi>Aſſert</hi> it. Both Propoſitions are <hi>hitherto ſuppoſed doubtful,</hi> Therefore He who maintains truth is obliged to raiſe his Propoſition from that low State of à poor <hi>Perhaps</hi> or doubting, to à higher Degree of certainty. The
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:102688:210"/> Catholick ſpeaks plainly and Argues thus. Gods euidenced Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle which beares the Marks, the Enſigns of Chriſt Ieſus, and taught the world from the Beginning, obliges all as well to belieue à Purgatory, as à Trinity of Perſons. I cannot therefore, Saith he, without à Forfeiture of all Reaſon and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing againſt the Publick wiſdom of the Chriſtian world, Own this à faithful Oracle in the Propoſal of the one Myſtery, and hold it Perfidious or Traiterous in the other. Here is the Catholicks Euidence. Now Mark well.

If he plead by Scripture he neuer get's aboue the degree of doubting, If he take recourſe to Hiſtory or any other Principle what euer, He shal find himſelf at the end of his labour, where he was at the Beginning as doubtful in his Proofs as in his Aſſertion. And why? He hath no euidenced Church to rely on. But more of this hereafter. See alſo. <hi>Diſc. 1. C.</hi> 11.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Other Inferences drawn from the precedent Doctrin. Atheiſts and Heretick, Argue alike. The Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of Credibility lead to à total Belief of what euer the true Church Propoſeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A word of Mr Thorndicks Mistakes concerning the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe firſt Inference. All that's pleadable in Behalf of Proteſtancy or any particular Tenet thereof, is not only doubtful but highly improbable, vpon Theſe two Principles. Firſt, that à Church euidenced by the very ſame Marks and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues which Chriſt our Lord Shewed to the world, reiect's the<note place="margin">Two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> Nouelty, (And no Authority on earth can Conteſt with an Oracle ſo clearly Manifeſt.) The other Principle. No Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſignalized with the like Motiues as the Roman Catholick Church Demonſtrat's, euer maintained ſo much as one Tenet of the Proteſtants Doctrin. Here the ingenuous Reader is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to reflect à little how we proceed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I proue my Catholick Doctrin by the Publick Authority of an euidenced Church, (That's my Principle) And our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries to Oppoſe me come armed with two or three maim'd<note place="margin">The Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Church is null And why?</note> dark Sentences, of the Holy Fathers and think this enough to caſt Popery out of the world. No ſuch Matter my good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, There is yet much more to do, before you ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably. You explode <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, Inuocation of Saints.</hi> We Ask whether you euer had à Church as Euidenced, as Ancient, as vniuerſal, as Commiſſioned to teach as ours, which publickly maintained your Tenets and cenſured The Roman Catholick Doctrin? Show vs ſuch à Church vpon ſolid Principles the work is done, you giue weight For weight, Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce for Euidence, and may Speak boldly, Nay I ſay more, you may
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:102688:211"/> well triumph, For vpon the Suppoſition, we are vanquished; But Fail to do this (and fail you muſt) you are ſilenced, yea, impoſſibilitated to write more Controuerſies. Se more of this Subiect aboue. Diſc. 1. C. 19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A ſecond inference. The Atheiſt and Proteſtant plead alike. That is. As the one Argues againſt God, iuſt ſo the other doth againſt Chriſt's Church. All know the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Atheiſts offer'd not poſitiuely to Demonſtrate the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence of God, for there is no Principle to ground that Senſleſs Aſſertion vpon, But chiefly excepted againſt the Proofs<note place="margin">The Atheiſts way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l'd with that of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries.</note> drawn from the viſible works in Nature and thought theſe ſo weak to Euince à Deity, that there might well be none. Thus our Sectaries proceed. For ſtark shame they dare not deny à Church of Chriſt, Yet their whole labour is ſo to obſcure Her Euidence, that no man can poſſibly find out the Oracle by <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Miracles, Conuerſions, and Antiquity.</hi> Therefore as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt in effect denies God, or at leaſt ſtand's doubtfull of his Being, So the Sectary, to parallel him, becauſe He denies the Churches glorious Euidence, cannot but remaine doubtful, whether there be any ſuch Oracle or no. Again as the Atheiſt bewrayes his folly in giuing the Lie to the vniuerſal Iudgement of mankind, when he Saies the works of Nature proue not à Deity, So the Sectary run's the ſame Carreer, betrayes his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and giues the Lie to the whole Chriſtian world, when he ſaies, the Manifeſt works of Grace, viſible in the Catholick Church conuince Her not to be God's Oracle.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A third inference. The ſole Euidence of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church viſible by Her Marks, ſo clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces and carries on the whole Catholick Cauſe without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">A Church clearly eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against.</note> So utterly vanquishes the Proteſtants Plea of Errours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into this great moral Body, that it is highly improbable, yea à flat Calumny to impeach Her of any. Here is my reaſon. Meer doubts, or craſy Topicks can not reuerſe Euidence, But the Churches Antiquity, Her vaſt extent, Her Progreſs, Her Miracles, Her Conuerſions and the other like Signes, are
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:102688:211"/>

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>x ſenſatis,</hi> ſenſibly and vndeniably euident; Therefore all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleading Her of Errour is more than improbable, vnleſs She has erred in shewing ſuch Marks as haue made the world Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Now further. If this Euidence ſtand's firm, Her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin is made euidently Credible by it, that is, ſo worthy of Acceptance by diuine Faith, That Reaſon, after ſo much Light ſeen, is obliged vnder pain of damnation to yeild Aſſent to the Doctrin. For, as none can prudently belieue, before this Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be attained. (<hi>Qui cito credit levis est corde, Eccleſ.</hi> 19. 44. One too quick in belieuing is not wiſe) So none after t'is had, can without damnable ſin Diſbelieue.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence I Argue. The Doctrin of the Primitiue Church was made euidently credible to reaſon (That is) worthy of all Acceptation in the three or four firſt Centuries, or was not;<note place="margin">The Primiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue euidence of Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> If not; none could then belieue, with diuine Faith; For the Euidence of credibility neceſſarily preceed's Faith, And as Faith in it ſelf is ſtrong, moſt certain, and victorious ouer Incredulity (<hi>Iohn 1. 5. 4. This is the victory which ouercom's the world, our Faith</hi>), So this preuious Euidence, anſwerably brings Reaſon to ſo firm à State of belieuing certainly, that nothing Propoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble can Eclipſe that clear and manifeſt light.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Contrarywiſe, if thoſe Primitiue Chriſtians had the Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we ſpeak of, and were thereby obliged to belieue, We Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks<note place="margin">Is yet mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</note> are Moſt ſecure, for the very ſame Euidence ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to this Age in the Roman Catholick Church. Miracles go on, Conuerſions of Nations go on, the Succeſſion of Paſtors goes on, The fulfilling of Propheſies goes on, Sanctity of life in Thouſands and Thouſands, is manifeſt to our eyes and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Euery day the Church growes older, and which is enough to conuince the moſt obdurate Heretick, the louely vnion, the vnanimous Conſent, of ſo many Nations though <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>different in tongues, in manners in Education, (conſpiring, and openly Profeſſing one and the ſame faith,) hath not only gained our Church à publick Reputation the whole world ouer, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:102688:212"/> proues this great Truth, That she, and none but she, is Gods Sacred Oracle.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If then (and here lies the force of my Inference) it had been à flat calumny and more than vaſtly improbable, to haue taxed the Apoſtolical Primitiue Church of Ertour after ſo great<note place="margin">The force of the Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> Euidence laid forth to Reaſon in Her Marks and Signs, it is no leſs ſinful in the Proteſtant now, no leſs vngodly at this day, to accuſe the preſent Church of corrupted Dectrin, whilſt She frees her ſelf from the Calumny, by giuing in the very ſame Euidence of Credibility. For here is my irrefragable Principle. The like full euidence of motiues lead's reaſon to draw Thence à moſt firm and certain Faith. Deſtroy this Euidence in any, that proues Himſelf to be Gods Oracle, you muſt deny it to Chriſt our Lord when he preached, To the Primitiue Church alſo, and finally to the Modern Catholick Church. Do ſo, All Faith perishes; Grant it to both the Ancient Church and this now in being, All plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt our Catholick Doctrin is meer Vanity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Sectary may reply. Though the Euidence we inſiſt on hath ſome weight. Yet it followes not, that all the Doctrin<note place="margin">An Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> our Church teaches is made euidently Credible, For he can iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly except againſt the Doctrin, relying vpon other ſolid Grounds, and moſt approued Principles. Scripture, for example, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of holy Fathers, the Records of Antiquity, the Form of the Primitiue Church, are his Principle, and by theſe he hopes to proue our Churches Doctrin Falſe, which done the Euidence we build vpon, ſignifies nothing.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I am very willing to ſolue this Obiection, the Anſwer I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, will show vpon what vnſteedy foundations Proteſtancy ſtand's. To proceed with all clarity. This is Queſtionable, whether we, or Proteſtants, teach the Doctrin of Ieſus Chriſt. And becauſe it is here impoſſible to deſcend to all particular controuerſies, we will fall vpon one only much debated (one ſerues for all). Viz whether Tranſubſtantiation, or no Tranſubſtantiation, be Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Doctrin. The truth yet lies in darkneſs, there is no <hi>Self-Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> either in the Affirmatiue or Negatiue, T'is yet no more but
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:102688:212"/> doubtful, or à meer Perhaps, whether the Proteſtants or we Speak Truth; Gods reuelation which only can giue certainty is<note place="margin">Where the difficulty lies?</note> yet obſcure to vs both, and as little euidenceth it Self, as the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we enquire after. By what means then can we raiſe our ſelues aboue this ſtate of Doubting to ſo great à degree of certainty, as to Say without fear. <hi>Tranſubſtantiation is Orthodox Doctrin.</hi> And the contrary, is not ſo.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Catholick (to waue in this place other proofs) recur's to his Church, And ſaith this Publick euidenced Oracle, as well raiſes him to à State of certainty for his Tenet, as the euidenced Primitiue Church raiſ'd the firſt belieuing Chriſtians from their doubts to Security. For the like full euidence alwayes lead's to<note place="margin">How the Catholick Peoceed's.</note> a like certainty of Belief. The Proteſtant, hauing reiected our preſent euidenced Church, hopes well, and will needs find flawes and falſity too in Her Doctrin, not by confronting Her Euidence, or <hi>denoting an other Church,</hi> As ample, as ancient, as miraculous, as She is, which held his Doctrin, for this, though it should be pleaded, (if we come to à clear Deciſion,) is vnpleadable, becauſe the Proteſtant has no ſuch Oracle. What's done therefore? I'll tell you, and you may iuſtly wonder. He shaks of this clear Principle of an euidenced Church and pretend's, (though there is no ſuch matter) to launch into the vaſt Ocean of <hi>Scripture, Councils, volumes of Fathers, ancient Records</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>and thinks<note place="margin">The Sectary takes à Contrary way.</note> to carry on his cauſe this way. Here He pick's vp one dark Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of à Father, and triumph's with that, There on another. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vpon the leaſt hint giuen he Snarles at one piece of Popery, there at another. Here he gueſses, and there he miſſes. In à word the man is buſily idle, doth much, and iuſt nothing, run's on, but is out of his way, utterly loſt, without the guidance of God's euidenced Oracle which only can draw him out of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth. And if you Ask, why he is out? I Anſwer his Errour lies here, that both in this and all other Controuerſies, he makes his falſe Suppoſitions to paſs for proofs againſt euidence.</p>
               <p n="11">11. You shall ſee what I here Aſſert Made Good. To proue no Tranſubſtantiation the Se&amp;ary read's Scripture, Fathers, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:102688:213"/> or what els you will. Be it ſo. He read's but not alone, For the learned Catholick bear's him companie and read's alſo. Mark now. The One after his reading gloſſes, ſo doth the ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her. The One compares Paſſage with Paſſage, ſo doth the ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her. The One diſcourſes, So doth the other. But when all is done (and here lies the miſchief) the Proteſtant impoſes one ſenſe vpon the peruſed Teſtimonies, and the Catholick another<note place="margin">Which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues him in State of doubting.</note> quite contrary. This dayly Experience teaches. viz. That we differ not ſo much about the words we read as about the ſenſe of Scripture and Fathers. Therefore this alſo is Euident, That the Proteſtant aduances not his Doctrin (if yet he get ſo high) aboue the degree of gueſſing only, whilſt he pleads by his gloſſed Scripture, and Fathers, For as long as the Catholick, wholly as learned and conſcientious as He is, and an ample Church beſides, oppoſes his far-fetch'd Senſe out of the Fathers, He cannot without Impudency, and making à falſe Suppoſition to paſs for his Proof, cry it vp as certain: Now further. As the ſenſe he drawes from Scripture and the Fathers is no more, but at moſt doubtful, (I ſay improbable) ſo his Aſſertion concerning no Tranſubſtantiation, or what euer els he holds contrary to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick faith, is wholly as much wauering, or purely doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: But that which is only doubtful and no more is too weak,<note place="margin">What euer is doubtful grounds not Faith.</note> either to ground any Chriſtian Tenet vpon, or to Contraſt with the Roman Catholick Church, whoſe Doctrin is indiſputably ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de euidently credible. Therefore unleſs à weake Vncertainty can reuerſe Euident Credibility, the Sectaries Plea againſt the Church, is not only improbable, but highly improbable.</p>
               <p n="12">12. To conclude this Point. Here is an vnanſwerable Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. It is poſſible to Denote, and point at another Church (which without diſpute taught Proteſtant Doctrin and oppoſed ours) as Ancient, as large, and euery way as Euidenced to ſenſe and reaſon, as the Roman Catholick Church is, Or it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. If poſſible, controuerſies are ſtrangely ended, for proue<note place="margin">A Dilemma.</note> me once ſuch à Church, I ſay plainly. There is no ſuch thing as true Faith in the world worthy defenſe. Why? Becauſe if the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:102688:213"/> hold's two different Churches euidenced à like, equally as ancient, as efficacious in Doctrin and glorious in Miracles, clash with one another, <hi>Say and Vnſay, approue, and condemn.</hi> The one condemn's Proteſtancy, The other Popery, One will haue Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation belieued, The other not, which is as wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructiue of Chriſtian Faith, as if Scripture it ſelf should plainly Speak Contradictions.</p>
               <p n="13">13. On the other ſide, If the Sectary can neither name, nor point at à Chutch (euery way as euidenced as the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick)<note place="margin">No euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church, no pleading for Protestancy.</note> which expreſly propugned Proteſtancy and oppoſed Popery, He shall neuer utter probable word againſt any one Article of our Catholick Faith; For throw an <hi>euidenced Protestant Church</hi> out of the world, All that is allegable in behalfe of its Doctrin, or againſt vs, will either End in à ſlight diſcharge, of à few ſcattered vnweighed Sentences of holy Fathers (no ſooner read than Anſwered) or, as we dayly Experience, in groſs Miſtakes, and bold Calumnies laid on our Doctrin. And can theſe think ye extinguish the viſible Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre of our Chureh, can theſe leſſen the euident Credibility of Her Doctrin, or bring ſo known and owned an Oracle into open diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, or publick Diſreputation? It is impoſſible. The moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Abbettors of Proteſtancy may not only blush to Aſſert it, but will be bafled did we once liue to ſee the happy day, when our iuſt cauſe might be propoſed, and heard in à Publick Diſpute, befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Learned and impartial Iudges.</p>

Such are Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks as leaue this Church, I grant 2. Saluation was, and will euer be had in this Church, Yet ſay. 3. It is Calumny, yea à plain Contradiction, to grant Saluation attainable in this Church, and to impeach Her of Errour or corrupted Do &amp; rin. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny<note place="margin">Church Motiues ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proue that Oracle pure in all She teaches, or in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> is vnqueſtionable becauſe the Marks, the ſignes and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Euidence of our Church already inſiſted on, either proue her Gods Oracle as ſound and faithful in all She teaches as the Primitiue Church was, or conuince nothing. What then can theſe Aduerſaries ayme at? Will they grant Her no leſs illvſtrious in Marks and Motiues which induce to faith than the Apoſtical Church was, and yet make Her à Monſter, à harlot, and prefidiouſly falſe in propoſing Faith? Haue ſo many learned Doctors Age after Age taught Her Doctrin, ſo many Martyts shed their blood In defenſe of it, ſo many Saints wrought glorious Miracles to confirm it, and after all can it vpon no proof but vpon à vain and moſt vniuſt Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be called falſe and vnorthodox? Nothing can be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re extrauagant. You muſt therefore either deny the Euidence we plead by, (which is vndeniable) or own this Church entirely ſound in euery Doctrin propoſed, <hi>as Faith.</hi> Whence it is that when Iewes, Gentils, and Hereticks, conuert themſelues to Catholick
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:102688:214"/> Religion, drawn thervnto by the light of euident Motiues, they frankly belieue no Part, but all Church Doctrin without Exception.

C. 5. 6. where we Demonſtrate, that if the Roman Catholick Church has erred in the propoſal but of one Point of Faith, and obliged Chriſtians to belieue that vnder pain of Damnation, She is not only traiterous to Chriſt, and therefore can be belieued in nothing, But moreouer at this preſent day there is no true Faith profeſſed in the Chriſtian world. Contrarywiſe, if She be true and vnerrable in all teaches, She is to be belieued in euery Article without reſerue.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Now to the double Contradiction in the words alleged. It is granted Saith. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Thorndicke <hi>that there is, and alwayes was Saluation to be had in the Church of Rome as à true Church, though corrupted.</hi> I Anſwer this is implicatory. For if true, She is not corrupted in Doctrin; or if corrupted in Doctrin She is not true; Vnleſs one makes by meer fancy à Chimera of the Catholick Church, and ſayes à true Church may be corrupted which is impoſſible, for truth excludes corruption: Therefore no Orthodox Chriſtian euer owned à Church partly true, partly falſe. You Sr, ſay. 2. Saluation may be had in this Church.

See more. <hi>Diſc. 1. C. 21. n.</hi> 7. Finally, wheras you Aſſert. <hi>No Church can Separate from the Church of Rome, but they muſt make themſelues thereby Schiſmatieks before God,</hi> The Inference Sr, is true, but moſt clear againſt your Selfe, And proues that both you and the Proteſtant Party are Schiſmaticks before God and man too. For this matter of Fact, Viz. That you Separated from,<note place="margin">Protestants proued Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</note> and rebelled againſt the Roman Catholick Church is as euident, as That England, once Catholick, communicated with Rome in

Reply, or tell vs you had cauſe to do ſo, and ſo far only receded from this Church, as She receded from Her Ancient purity, You make again à falſe Suppoſition your Proof, your ſelf Iudge in à cauſe you haue nothing to doe with, And the louely Spouſe of Chriſt loyal and perfidious, Chaſt and à harlot with one breath.</p>

Now on the other ſide, if you ſay the Roman Catholick was and is à true Church,<note place="margin">Another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as clear.</note> and that the English alſo is altogether as true as she, or hath not ſeparated from the Roman in matter <hi>of true Doctrin;</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes ineuitably, if the Suppoſition hold's, that neither of them needs Reformation in matter of Truth (for here we ſpeak not of Rites and Ceremonies which are alterable.) To what purpoſe then is it to talk of reforming either Church, in point <hi>of Truth,</hi> when both are Suppoſed ſo true, that neither can be reformed, nor differ, if true in faith, from one another?</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Perhaps you may (yea and muſt) reply, if your Diſcourſe
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:102688:215"/> haue ſenſe. Though they are true in Doctrins called funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, yet both haue their leſſer corruptions, and theſe need Reformation. This is all that can be Aſſerted, For if both are falſe in fundamentals neither of them at this day is the Orthodox Church of Chriſt, and conſequently both the Romaniſts and English wanting fundamentals, are People eſſentially Churchleſs. Now vpon the Suppoſition of leſſer corruptions only not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, you haue à dreadful Inference againſt Proteſtants, And as true, as dreadful. Viz. That their firſt Separation from the Roman Catholick Church was damnably Sinful, though She were here falſly ſuppoſed to haue erred in ſmaller matters; This, I<note place="margin">A third In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> Say followes, not only becauſe the Ancient Fathers expreſly teach, No Reformation can be of ſuch Importance, as to counteruaile the danger of Diuiſions, And that all things should be rather tolerated than to conſent to Schiſm in the Church; But vpon this other account alſo, that the Reuolt of Proteſtants from our Ancient Church hath laid ſuch à viſible diſgrace vpon à noble Kingdom, That none but the powerful hand of God, with the wiſdom of our Gracious Souereign and the States concurrence,<note place="margin">Touching vpon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leful Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> can take it of. The Nation, we ſee with our eyes, is ſtrangely diuided, hideouſly diſcompoſed, Religion is of the hinges, and men generally are ſo tranſported into Extrauagancies; that none can ſay what the Religion is which England Profeſſes at this day, There are ſo many Sects, ſo many Diuiſions, ſo many Tub-Preachers, ſo many woemen-Goſpellers, ſo many Quakers, ſo many Fanaticks, ſo many Leuiathan-Monſters, that you may read and ſee without turning to the Bible, à Babylonian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, amongſt them. Would Popery, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. think ye, (you are as I vnderſtand moderate, and learned) had that continued, laid England vnder ſuch à publick Diſgrace as this Rabble of men, and Fanaticks haue done? Let the world iudge.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Now if you Ask, from whence came this fearful Diſorder, which to my ſorrow makes our Country ridiculous to forrain Nations? I anſwer. The firſt Rent, the firſt Rupture, the firſt Schiſm of Proteſtants from the Catholick Church, occaſioned

As ye Proteſtants without recourſe to any other iudge but your Selues vpon your own Authority quitted the Roman Catholick Church, and thought your Fact reaſonable; So we Fanaticks, without recourſe to any but our own tender Conſciences, (knowing you began à Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation not yet compleat) leaue Proteſtancy, And hold our fact as reaſonable as yours: And thus others by your firſt Example<note place="margin">The Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Protestants.</note> may reform Religion to the worlds end.

And is it poſſible, shall all theſe vnreformed People reform one another? This difficulty cannot be ſolued in Proteſtant principles.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. I ſay in à word.

To you or me, or to any priuate fallible man? You talk as if, forſooth, the Primitiue Doctrin were ſo apparently Manifeſt to People, that euery one by opening Books and reading Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, may with à wet ſinger clearly diſcouer the true and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Form of Religion, Wheras the contrary is euident, For haue not we and Proteſtants (to omit others) now for à whole Age peruſed Councils, and Fathers, and after all, do we not ſee with our eyes, that what ſeem's Orthodox Doctrin to one Party, ſeem's not ſo to the other? It appears manifeſtly to me, that the Primitiue Fathers, ſo openly maintained an vnbloody Sacrifice vpon the Altar, that the wit of man cannot without violence, wreſt them to à contrary ſenſe; doth the Truth appear ſo to Proteſtants? It appeared to S. Cyprian <hi>Epiſt. 55. ad Cornel.</hi>

Mr Thorndick will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the preſent Roman Church Corrupted, by the Primitiue ſuppoſed pure for the firſt 4. or. 5. Ages. I muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand firſt, whether that Primitiue Church, the Rule of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation<note place="margin">Queſtions propoſed to our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> was infallible, and pure in thoſe pretended fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals only, neceſſary to Saluation, though not in other Doctrins of leſſer Moment? Or. 2. Whether She (becauſe fallible) as much needed Reformation in ſmaller Matters not called fundamental, as this preſent Church is ſuppoſed to need? Or. 3. Whether She was ſo entirely pure in euery doctrin, little, and great, that She could not be brought to more Purity, or be better Reformed? Grant the firſt. viz. That the Primitiue Church was vnerrable and pure in fundamentals only, not in others, The preſent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church is as good as She was, For our Aduerſary own's Her à true Church wherein Saluation may be had, and thus far She needs no reforming. Grant. 2. that both theſe Churches, becauſe fallible, might erre, and perhaps haue erred in leſſer Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not named fundamental, The Primitiue can be no Rule of Reformation to the preſent Church, becauſe that Primitiue is alike err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>, alike reformable, And for ought men know, as much out of the way of truth in Non-fundamentals as the preſent Church is; Therefore I ſaid aboue, if the blind cannot lead the blind, à Church wanting Reformation cannot reform another ſick of the ſame malady.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. If finally it be Said, the Primitiue Church was ſo infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, ſo pure euery way, both in great and little Matters, that She could not be more reformed in the firſt 5. Centuries for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: We haue à Church once entirely pure, And then vrge our<note place="margin">Herein Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> Aduerſary not barely to ſay it, But to proue vpon indubitable Principles, <hi>Scriptures, Fathers,</hi> or the <hi>General Conſent of Chriſtians,</hi> that She continued not wholly as pure in the ſixt, ſeuenth, or eight Age, and ſo downward to our dayes as She was before. To shew à Deficiency in this Church once confeſſedly true, in after Ages, will be more than an Herculian labour, when it is demonſtratiuely euidenced aboue, That nothing but à Church
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:102688:218"/> equally as Ancient, as Vniuerſal, and glorious in Miracles as the Roman is, can probably impeach Her of the leaſt Corruption. Mr Thorndicks Miſtake is, that he makes (as Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vſually do) à falſe Suppoſition his Proof; He ſuppoſes<note place="margin">A ſuppoſition made à Proof.</note> our Church corrupted in Doctrin, and then will amend it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his fancy by the Primitiue, whereas he knowes, or ought to know, that we Catholicks deny His Suppoſition, and ſay both are vnerrable, and withall Aſſert, that no Authority on earth can better inform vs of the Primitiue Doctrin than the preſent Roman Church, which hath ſucceſſiuely handed it to vs Age after Age.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. AS the Anſwer to the Queſtion aym's at à clear and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy way of ending Controuerſies Concerning Religion, So the following Diſcourſe tend's to ſettle one great truth in the minds of euery one. viz. That both the Ancient, and preſent Roman Catholick Church is not only infallible, But that the<note place="margin">what we intend to proue.</note> Aduerſaries of Her infallibility deſtroy the very Eſſence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, And deſeruedly merit vpon that Account, The name of Schiſmaticks and Heretiques alſo.</p>

                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:102688:218"/>2. To make good what's now Aſſerted, à few <hi>Postulata</hi> or Principles muſt be premiſed. One is. That Church which Promiſes, and proues Herſelfe infallible in Doctrin doth not only<note place="margin">Vpon theſe following Principles.</note> facilitate, but giues alſo abſolute Security to Faith, For ſuch à Church Participat's moſt, and comes neereſt to that firſt Diuine Apoſtolical Spirit, which confeſſedly was infallible.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Principle. Whereas nothing hath, or ought to haue, à ſtronger Influence ouer the minds of men than Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, So nothing can diſcountenance it more, than à ſtedfaſt Perſwaſion of its Fallibility, and Conſequently, of it's eaſily being Falſe. This Perſwaſion Cut's of all Chriſtian Aſſurance, and driues men to ſo cold an Indifference of embracing this or that Religion, That it much import's not which to take to, any or none.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A. 3. Principle. The means or influence whereby Chriſt preſerues his Church infallible, needs not to be explicated by any Supernatural quality, perſonally inhering in the <hi>Teaching Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatiue,</hi> or intrinſecally eleuating the conuened Prelates to à State of Infallibility; for t'is enough, that the ſafe Conduct of Almighty God, who is alwaies vigilant, and Aſſiſts by his exteriour Protection, ſo ſecures the Church from errour, that She neither<note place="margin">What the Churches Infallibility requires.</note> can be miſled, when She teaches, nor miſlead others. Yet I deny not but that an interiour Motion of Grace may be, yea and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is in the hearts of ſuch as are Aſſembled together in God's name, and Aſſiſted to define infallibly. Diuine Faith, Tis true actually elicited, euen after the permanent Habit infuſed, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res à Supernatural Motion of Grace, But hereof we ſpeak not at preſent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A. 4. Principle. When it is enquired Whether the Church Diſtuſiue be infallible, the Querie is not, whether the Motiues inducing to diſtinguish that Oracle from others, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratiuely and with all Metaphyſical certitude, euidence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Gods Reuelation relating to the Myſteries <hi>Belieued;</hi> For this might lead vs to enquire whether Faith be euident in <hi>Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante,</hi> That is, ſo Vnexceptionably manifeſt, that all may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:102688:219"/> Infer from the Reuelation clearly known, That the Myſteries belieued, are euidently true. We now meddle not with that Difficulty, though great Diuines patronize the Affirmatiue, But only Ask, Whether the Doctrin of Chriſt's Church be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly Certain, that it cannot be Falſe or deceiue any. Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks<note place="margin">The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion Stated.</note> own à triple infallibility neceſſary to Faith. The firſt proper to God's Reuelation, no Proteſtant denies that. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond belongs to the Church, either <hi>Diffuſiue,</hi> or <hi>Repreſentatiue</hi> in General Councils, whereby we learn, and that infallibly, thoſe Truths which God reueals. The third infallible Aſſurance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Faith, all Orthodox Chriſtians haue, that belieue the<note place="margin">A threefold Infallibility.</note> Myſteries reuealed vpon the Diuine Teſtimony, Propoſed by Chriſt's Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A. 5. Principle. If, (what is moſt vndoubted) Diuine Faith eſſentially relies vpon Gods infallible Verity ſpeaking by one or more men ſent to Teach, (who proue their Miſſion and Demonſtrate the <hi>Credibility</hi> of the Doctrin deliuered) it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily followes, That, that firſt infallible Verity beget's in euery true Belieuer, no leſs perfect Faith Than what is moſt certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Wherefore as it is the indiſpenſable Duty of euery belieuing Chriſtian to acquieſe <hi>in,</hi> and reſt <hi>vpon</hi> God's infallible<note place="margin">Mans Duty grounded on Chriſt's Promiſe.</note> Veracity; So it is an indiſpenſable Promiſe, That we haue Chriſt preſent with à Church which teaches all Truth, And therefore cannot but Propoſe the Obiect of Faith infallibly. The firm Promiſe irreuokably iſſued from Power and Goodnes it ſelfe, <hi>Matt. 28. 20. I am with you alwayes to the end of the world. Iohn. 14. 16. I will Ask the Father, and he will giue you an other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, the Spirit of truth to remain with you for euer.

               <p n="7">7. The Difficulty now agitated is. Whether the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church and Her approued General Councils be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from Errour, That She cannot ſwerue from that firſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Truth, (I mean God's infinit Veracity) But muſt when She teaches, Teach that exactly which God hath reuealed, and will haue after à ſufficient Propoſal, Vniuerſally belieued.

                  <hi>Primary Fundamentals,</hi> (as they are Called) or in Fundamentals <hi>Simply neceſſary</hi> to Saluation, And they were forced to this wicked Doctrin vpon three naughty Motiues.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

This is done, to quit themſelues of an Infamy iuſtly laid vpon them, of being both Schiſmaticks and Heretiques at once, which shall neuer be claw'd of, do what they can. For theſe vnſound reaſons, or peſtilent<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Motiues rather, The Church forſooth muſt needs be fallible. Catholicks on the other ſide, maintain the contrary, And ſay there is à Church ſo Infallible, that She cannot err in any thing She teaches, as <hi>Faith.</hi> And thus much God willing shall be euinced in the following Diſcourſe. But to do it exactly, I am briefly to lay open to all that haue eyes, The Abiect, the Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and Deſolate condition of à fallible Church. You haue here my firſt Propoſition.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>A fallible Church is eſſentially Constituted, in à State of publick</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A fallible Church is in à State of rebellion.</note> 
                  <hi>Rebellion and Hostility with it Self, Wages war againſt Infidels without hope of conuincing, or conquering any:</hi> And therefore cannot be Chriſt's Orthodox Church. To declare further what I would ſay know firſt, That Sectaries own à Catholick Church much larger than the Roman Catholick, And make Themſelues Part of it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue now (which though very hard is yet poſſible), that the <hi>Repreſentatiue</hi> of this great Moral Body meet's in à General Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncil, and diſcuſſes the Queſtion now in hand. Viz. <hi>Whether there be à Church of one Denomination Preſerued infallible</hi> by Diuine
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:102688:220"/> Aſſiſtance? Part of the Repreſentatiue, and theſe are Proteſtants, Oppoſe the total Infallibility of euery Church. Part (Catholicks I mean) Say one Church is infallible, and that is the <hi>Roman.</hi> The Difficulty propoſed can be decided, or not. If not; This great Repreſentatiue meet's to no purpoſe, but only to make more<note place="margin">No means to vnite it.</note> Strife in the world. If it can be decided, God has prouided means whereby the truth of ſo weighty à Matter may be known, But there is no ſuch means left, vnleſs ſome one Church or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (or all together) be owned infallible, Therefore an endles Hoſtility goes on, in this ſuppoſed <hi>Repreſentatiue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. That all means fail may Sectaries Votes haue place, is indiſputably Euident. You shall ſee it clearly. The Catholick Party Appeales to Scripture, alleges theſe and other like Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.<note place="margin">Without ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me One Church be Infallible</note>

Wherefore the Nicene Fathers Condemnation of Arius might haue been iuſtly excepted againſt and pleaded reuerſable vpon this ground, That what they defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (becauſe fallible) might be as far from Truth, as the very Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours they Cenſured, and defined againſt. Nay I ſay more: If that Council was then fallible, it lies yet at the mercy, not only of Arians, but of all Chriſtians at this day, to admit, or reiect, the Nicene Cenſure, or rather, if Prudence haue place, to ſus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend<note place="margin">Strange ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quels if the Church be fallible</note> their Iudgements and ſay, no man knowes what to belieue.

Of all Obiections propoſable, this is leaſt worth.

               <p n="20">20. Again, and this Reaſon conuinceth.

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:102688:225"/> doubfully, which is not to belieue at all. Again If the Churches<note place="margin">She wrongs both Arians and All Chriſtians</note> Definition get à Step higher, to à degree of Probability and no more; The Arians Opinion for ought we know yet, may be as tenable as the Contrary Doctrin now ſuppoſed Orthodox, And Conſequently the real Conſubſtantiality of the Son to his Father, is no more any Obiect of Faith, but meerly à diſputable Matter like this or that Opinion in Schools, earneſtly toſſed to and fro, But neuer ended. Doubts therefore, And meer probabilities reiected, too weightles for Church Definitions,</p>
               <p n="5">5. We are next to look à little into one only Refuge left<note place="margin">The Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Plea of Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> Sectaries, called <hi>Moral Certainty.</hi> T'is à dark cloud, they are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely got into, our Endeauour shall be to diſſipate it. They may ſay. When the Church condemned Arianiſm (the like is of any other Hereſy) and defined the Eternal <hi>Word</hi> Conſubſtantial. The Definition (much aboue Probability) though not abſolutely Infallible, was yet ſo morally Certain that no man can, but moſt vnreaſonably, doubt of its Verity. In paſſing, I may without Offence take notice of Sectaries Inconſequences, and Ask, if Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Certainty be at leaſt had from Church Definitions, when She interpret's Scripture, though the Doctrin be not formally expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed There, Why are not Her Definitions euery whit as Morally certain againſt Luther and Caluin, though what She Defin's be not in <hi>expreſs Terms</hi> Gods word? I would alſo as willingly learn, why Proteſtant Doctrin is not eſteemed ouer all the world ſo Morally certain as thefe Ancient Catholick Definitions are? But let theſe Queries, not eaſily Anſwered paſs, We come to the main difficulty, and demand.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether this Poſitiue Doctrin. <hi>Chriſt is the Highest God, and Conſubſtantial to his Father</hi> be à Fundamental Article of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith finally reſoluable into the Diuine Reuelation, And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted<note place="margin">A queſtion Propoſed to Sectaries.</note> as moſt Fundamental by Proteſtants? I verily perſwade my ſelf they will Say <hi>it is:</hi> If not; This followes ineuitably, that there is no fundamental Article in our Chriſtian faith. Vpon the ſuppoſed Conceſſion I Argue. But If the Church be falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, this Poſitiue Doctrin. <hi>Christ is Conſubſtantial.</hi> is no Article
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:102688:225"/> of Faith becauſe it cannot be reſolued into an infinite Verity infallibly Reuealing Truth, Therefore it is only à Moral humane Perſwaſion at moſt, which may be falſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Proof of the <hi>Minor,</hi> will beſt appear if we Ask why Sectaries belieue that poſitiue Doctrin? They cannot An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Scripture <hi>expreſly</hi> Teaches it; For moſt euidently that's not ſo. Will they ſay the Myſtery may by good Diſcourſe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced<note place="margin">The true Anſwer proues Faith Certain.</note> from Scripture? I Could wish to ſee à clear Deduction, yet fear it. Howeuer Suppoſe that done, new Doubts ariſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the certainty of the Deduction, which can be no more but morally certain, moſt inſufficient to ground Diuine Faith. The true Anſwer therefore muſt be, or none. The Nicene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, The both pas't, and Preſent Church faithfully interpreting Scripture, Definitiuely deliuered the Doctrin, and vpon this ground we belieue the Myſtery.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Now here we come to the main Buſineſs, and Ask again, whether God ſpeaking by this Church as his own Oracle, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that Doctrin and obliges all to belieue it, Or, Contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whether the Church diuorced as it were from Diuine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance teaches vpon Her own humane fallible Authority, And<note place="margin">The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euinced</note> obliges all to belieue the Myſtery? Grant the firſt, The Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of the Church are infallible, becauſe an Eternal Verity ſpeaks infallibly by Her. Say ſecondly, That the Church wholly Vnaſsiſted, teaches and Defines vpon Her own fallible humane Authority, the Doctrin we learn from Her of the <hi>Incarnation, of the higheſt Godhead in Chriſt,</hi> of his being <hi>Conſubſtantial, of the Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> beget's no Faith, Becauſe if the Suppoſition hold's, that Aſſent relies not at all vpon an <hi>Infallible Verity</hi> ſpeaking by the Church <hi>Aſsiſted,</hi> but vpon à weak and fallible Human Authority which cannot ſupport any certain Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, For it is moſt prepoſterous to Say, that men meerly falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as all are left to Themſelues, can Aſſure vs, what that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin is, which God Reueal's Infallibly. Now we Come to this Moral Certainty.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And one Perhaps will ſay, Such men, though fallible,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:102688:226"/> may at leaſt giue <hi>Moral Aſſurance</hi> of the truth of the Doctrin, and that's enough. Contra. 1. Moral aſſurance which euer implies ſome weak Degree of fear of the contrary may in rigour be falſe: But the Church, which obliges all to belieue Her Doctrin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Damnation ſpeak's without fear, and Saith boldly. God reueal's as I teach, Therefore her Doctrin if falſe, is the Diuels Doctrin. But none can ſay, That the Nicene Definition againſt Arius was the Doctrin of Diuels, But Contrarywiſe à Truth reuealed by God, and Belieuable <hi>Fide Diuina, Ergo</hi> it was infallible, and more than Morally certain. Contra. 2. God<note place="margin">The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions More then Moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Certain.</note> Speaking by the Church giues greater Certainty than Moral, And if he do not ſpeak at all by Her, the Definition now remoued from Infallible Aſſiſtance Vphold's not Faith, as we shall ſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, nor can it be prudently iudged morally certain.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Though much be ſaid in the other Treatiſe. <hi>Diſc. 1. C.</hi> 4. 6. againſt this Pretence to Moral certainty (Sectaries caſually light on it becauſe, forſooth, they brook not the word. <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi>) yet here we muſt wholly weaken that Plea. I ſay The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, could the Church (as She cannot) Define or teach wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout Gods ſpecial Aſſiſtance, Chriſtians would either not attain to ſo great certainty of Her Doctrin, <hi>as is Moral;</hi> Or if no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be had, That certainty would not <hi>be Diuine Faith.</hi> Euery one knowes Moral certainty to be à kind of knowledge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men iudge ſuch things are, or are not, without great Heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy or any reaſonable cauſe of Doubting, It is vſually grounded vpon ſome vulgar Perſwaſion, or common half owned Euidence, which the moſt of men truſt to prudently, When no ſurer can be had. Thus we ſay. <hi>All People in Common Conuerſation ſpeak not alwayes contrary to their thoughts. Some mean well in their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Nature of Moral certainly briefly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at.</note> 
                  <hi>Rome and Conſtantinople are now Citties in being.</hi> Theſe and the like Aſſertions may in rigour be falſe, Yet our Iudicatiue faculty without Violence readily yeild's to all, induced thereunto by à Perſwaſion vulgarly receiued whereby we ſay, That as ſuch things are Commonly reported, So they alſo are vſually belieued, and Commonly true. In à word the greateſt part of Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:102688:226"/> may be rightly ſtiled à kind of half Suppoſed Euidence, current in the world, which may Deceiue, yet eaſily deceiues not.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Now be pleaſed to reflect. The ſublime Myſteries of<note place="margin">A reflection</note> Faith, remote from all vulgar Apprehenſions and half owned Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, are neither viſible like Conſtantinople, ſeen by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Eye-wittneſſes, Nor aſſured vpon any either Fallible or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuable Authority, nor finally belieued vpon à meer humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Diſcourſe only. No. They lie in à higher Region aboue our natural knowledge in the Abyſs of Gods inſcrutable Wiſdom, and the more remote they are from Senſe Or any Half-euidences, the more they ſtand in need of an infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,<note place="margin">No Power deceiuable can ground Faith.</note> Whereby All reſt Aſcertained of their being Eternal Truths. Hence I Argue. None but God aboue who Reueal's, and an infallible Church which Propoſes the Myſteries can giue Aſſurance of their being Diuine Truths, or ſay abſolut'ly They ought to be belieued anſwerably to their Dignity, <hi>as Diuine.</hi> Now further. But if God reueal's them as his own Truths for this End, that all belieue them infallibly, the Church cannot but Speak in the name of God, and independently of this Vulgar<note place="margin">The inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Moral Certainty.</note> humane knowledge, Propoſe them alſo infallibly as Diuine, Or if She could turn vs off with no more but à Moral Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their <hi>ſeeming Gods truths,</hi> yet may not be ſo, The Strength of Faith vanishes into à diſſatisfactory Topick, into à meer <hi>Perhaps</hi> thus. <hi>It may be we Belieue Truth, it may be not.</hi> In à word we belieue not as the Apoſtles did, infallibly.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Hence none, I think, shall euer comprehend how this Whimſy of Moral Certainty got into our Proteſtants thoughts, For had Chriſtians agreed in that Certainty, or had they ſaid: Becauſe the Myſteries of faith are propoſed ſo weakly, <hi>We can belieue with no Stronger aſſurance but Moral,</hi> They muſt haue receiued and learn'd that Doctrin (not from their own fancy) but from ſome Superiour Power, ſome known Oracle that taught ſo, which either reuealed, or propoſed the Myſteries as only Morally certain, and no more. But to point at any ſuch Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:102688:227"/> is impoſſible, And here is the reaſon. All know, that God<note place="margin">Faith only Morally cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain reiected by all that taught Chriſtianity</note> an infallible Verity, cannot Reueal any Truth only Morally Certain. Chriſt our Lord taught his own Verities infallibly, ſo alſo did the Apoſtles who were Strangers to this low and half lame Aſſurance. No ancient Chriſtians nameable profeſſed à leſs certainty (of Faith) than infallible in the Church which taught them. The Roman Catholick Church you ſee for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing Reaſons, laies claim to diuine Aſſiſtance when She Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and diſclaims this petty kind of Certainty, which may be falſe: From whence then came the Perſwaſion of that certainty into mens Heads when neither God, nor Chriſt, nor Apoſtles nor Ancient Chriſtians, nor any Orthodox Church euer fauoured it?</p>
               <p n="13">13. The true Anſwer is, <hi>Inimcus homo hoc fecit.</hi> An old Enemy to decry the Infallibility of Gods own Oracle conueyed the fancy into à few Sectaries, Though when they haue it, it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes<note place="margin">The Author of Moral certainly.</note> wholly vſeles to end Controuerſies. Obſerue my reaſon. If theſe men Diſpute with à Iew, will they ſay that Chriſtian Religion, taken in what latitude you pleaſe, is not abſolutely infallible, but only à little More morally certain than Iudaiſm? Or if they Argue againſt vs can they be ſo shameleſs, as to allow Moral certainty to Proteſtancy and deny it to Catholick Religion? They muſt do ſo, and here is the reaſon. Moral certainty is neuer appliable to two Parts of à Contradiction, The One muſt<note place="margin">It is vſeles to Sectaries in all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes.</note> of neceſſity be made morally Improbable, (ſo if all iudge in this Inſtant that Conſtantinople is à Citty in being, the Contrary i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Morally improbable) if therefore Sectaries hold Proteſtancy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally certain and the Roman Catholick Doctrin not, This beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in their Opinion Morally improbable. Dare they ſay ſo much with any Countenance? If they doe, our Diſpute begins à fresh, we come to the Trial of their Aſſertion, and will show when it pleaſes them to hear, that their high challenge to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral certainty, is far from being probable. At leaſt this is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That whilſt we moſt rationally except againſt it, its only an vnproued Suppoſition and ends no Controuerſies.</p>

                  </gap>uſe Myſtery of the Sacred Trinity, As it is already ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly Defined. Suppoſe again that twenty learned men, (but fallible) after à peruſal of Scripture had endeauored to bring Themſelues and others to belieue it. viz. <hi>The Father of himſelf</hi>

All three Conſubſtantial, one in Eſſence, in Power, in Wiſdom, in Omnipotency, only distinguished by their Relatiue Oppoſitions.</hi> I ſay notwithſtanding; This their Aſſent would only haue been à weak Opinion not morally certain, and though hundreds more had Sided with theſe Twenty vpon the like Ground, none could haue belieued the Trinity with Diuine Faith. The reaſon is, Becauſe whilſt men meerly fallible (and as fallible) Propoſe an incomprehenſible Myſtery far aboue the reach of humane vnderſtanding, The Propoſal (relying vpon à deceiuable, Or an vnaſsiſted Power) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring Faith to it's own Obiect, <hi>Gods infallible veracity.</hi> The Reſolution of this ſuppoſed Faith clear's all. For Ask why They belieue the Trinity? It is Anſwered they verily think and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Themſelues that the Myſtery lies couched in Holy Writ. But Ask again, whether that Thought or Perſwaſion be not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, they Anſwer, <hi>affirmitiuely. Ergo,</hi> Say I, their Faith which cannot goe beyond the ſtrength of that weak Propoſition, is alſo fallible and conſequently not Diuine.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Here you ſee firſt, the abſolute Neceſſity of an infallible Proponent in Points of Faith, which Sectaries haue not, And therefore can belieue nothing Diuinely; And truly Catholicks would be in as bad à Condition (yea really no Catholicks)<note place="margin">An Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, neceſſary</note> could the Church only gueſs at theſe high Myſteries, could She propoſe them vpon à humane errable Authority only, Or in à word, Define Fallibly.

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:102688:228"/> belieues this, or any other Myſtery, his Anſwer is, God reueal's them. Queſtioned again who giues him ſo much Aſſurance? A ſatisfactory Reply is at hand. He belieues ſo, becauſe an Aſſiſted Church, which cannot Err, Propoſes all Her Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries infallibly. Take away Diuine Aſſiſtance, She is errable and may deceiue euery one She teaches.</p>
               <p n="16">16. One may here demand whether the Proteſtants Belief of the Trinity, or of any other high Myſtery growes vp to ſo much Certainty <hi>with them,</hi> as is Moral? Anſw. 1. It import's little whether it do or no, So long as their Faith is meerly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. I Anſwer 2. If we Speak rigorouſly, Their Belief is not<note place="margin">Sectaries haue no faith moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain.</note> morally certain. Here is my reaſon. Their own Diuining in ſo abſtruſe à Matter cannot raiſe the Aſſent ſo high, And if they would borrow, as it were, Certainty from the Catholick Church, and Apply that to Themſelues, They know well this Oracle Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes no other Certainty in the Belief of reuealed Truths, but what is infallible, and cannot be Falſe.</p>

But the Myſteries of Faith lie, as is now noted in à higher Region, and are neither propoſed nor conueyed to vs by the help of any viſible or ſenſible Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; And were they in ſome low degree morally certain vpon humane Reports, that would neither match, nor be ſo ſtrong as natural Euidence is.

               <p n="18">18. To end this point concerning Moral Certainty. I Ask<note place="margin">Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in Faith à moſt frigid Plea. And why?</note> (and for Anſwer appeal to the Iudgement of euery rational man) what cold comfort would it haue been to the Primitiue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, had the Nicene Fathers after à reſolute Definition iſſued forth, whereby the <hi>Conſubstantiallity</hi> of the Diuine Word was Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and à Peremptory <hi>Anathema</hi> Pronounced againſt all that belieued it not, Declared themſelues and Senſe in this frigid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? It is ſo indeed Defined. But we only mean thus much, That the Doctrin is morally certain and may be falſe. Would not Arius think ye haue ſlighted the Definition? And might he not haue Argued to the purpoſe Thus? If no man can hold himſelf happy for being actually in Errour, He cannot Certainly think himſelf out of the danger of an vnhappy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, if he be expoſed to the danger of Errour, But the Moral certainty you defend thruſt's you vpon the danger of being in Errour, Therefore your Condition is none of the ſureſt, Nay it is as bad as mine, For the worſt that can befall my Doctrin, which I pretend Scripture for, is, That it may one day proue falſe, and ſo may yours too (Good Fathers) if in the leaſt degree fallible.</p>

                  <p n="21">21. One, though enough broken already, muſt appear again in our New mens Terms, or nothing is done. Thus they Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. If Chriſtian Doctrin be in ſo high à Degree Morally Certain, As it is Certain that Caeſar, Pompey and Cicero were men once in Being, None can reaſonably doubt of the Doctrin, And why may not Such an Aſſurance Content vs, without our pretended Infallibility? I read this in Mr Stillingfleet more then once, And had I not ſeen it with my own Eyes, I Should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">Sectaries Mistaks concerning Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</note> haue thought, That One Profeſſing Knowledge in Diuinity could haue erred ſo enormouſly. To lay open the foule Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. All know the Certainty we haue of Caeſars once being in the world was firſt grounded vpon à Viſible clear Euidence, for Innumerable ſaw the man, heard him Speak, whilſt He liued on earth. The Verity euer ſince conueyd down from Age to Age Continues ſtill to our dayes, And here is all the Moral Certainty men can haue of Caeſar, of Pompey, or of any other, ſo remote from vs. Pleaſe now to obſerue. As Caeſar and Cicero were ſeen by many Eye-witneſſes, So Chriſt our Lord was both heard and ſeen by Innumerable when he Preached, and ſuffered on the Croſs. The Euidence to thoſe Spectators was Senſible and Phyſical, To Iewes and Gentils now, its Moral, who vpon à Vniuerſal report Say without boggling, There was once à man in the world called Chriſt, as they ſay, There was once One, Called Caeſar. But (and here we Come to diſcouer
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:102688:230"/> Mr Stillingfleets Errour) Do Theſe Iewes and Gentils therefore<note place="margin">To ſay Chriſt was vpon Moral certainly</note> belieue in Chriſt, or Aſſent to his Sacred Doctrin <hi>by Faith,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they Iudge vpon Moral Certainty, He was once on earth? Is this Truth, I ſay, <hi>As it is grounded vpon à Common Report,</hi> or Morally Certain the Obiect of Faith? It is more then ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.<note place="margin">is not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue in Chriſt.</note> For grant <hi>That,</hi> All the Iewes in Europe at this Day may be well thought to Belieue in Chriſt, becauſe they haue Moral Certainty of his once Being in the world.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. To Belieue in Chriſt Therefore, is not to Say, ſuch à man once had his Being, he Preach'd, and ſuffered (for this lay open to Senſe) But implyes Much more. viz. To Aſſert in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably vpon Diuine Reuelation. That the Man called Chriſt Ieſus was truely the Higheſt God, The only Meſſias, The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Mankind, Conſubſtantial to his Eternal Father and finally to Aſſent to Euery Doctrin he taught. Theſe and the<note place="margin">What is to belieue in Chriſt.</note> like Truths (neither viſible nor ſenſible, like Caeſar) are Obiects of Diuine Faith, far enough remoued from Phyſical and Moral Certainty, And we firmly Aſſent to All, not becauſe they are ſeen with our Eyes, or Scientifically known, Or finally Conueyed vnto vs vpon the weak Support of Moral certainty, But becauſe God an Infinite Verity has reuealed them. Here is our Ground. Now This Reuelation being not euidently known by virtue of any Principle in Nature, muſt be Belieued (together with the Obſcure Myſteries, <hi>Attested</hi>) by an Act of Diuine Faith.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And Hence it followes, That as no Obiect (<hi>as ſeen or</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Faith is more then morally Certain</note> 
                     <hi>Euidently known</hi>) Can terminate Supernatural Faith; So no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Certainty can be eſſential to it, Or vphold it. The vltimate Reaſon hereof is moſt Conuincing, and Briefly thus. <hi>What euer God reueal's</hi> (as it is reuealed) <hi>is Certain and Infallible Doctrin.

                  <p n="25">25. Now to deal fairely with Mr Stillingfleet, let vs at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent falſely Suppoſe Moral Certainty à ſufficient ground of Faith,<note place="margin">Were Church Doctrin only Morally certain, Sectaries yet gain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> what Good for Gods ſake get Proteſtants by that? Can They tell vs where the Church is, whoſe Doctrin muſt be reputed only morally certain? The Arians call themſelues à Church, ſo do the Graecians, the Proteſtants likewiſe, and finally ſo do Catholicks. Are all theſe different iarring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doctrins Morally certain? Euidently No. For the Profeſſors of them maintain Contradictions, vtterly Deſtructiue both of Moral and all other Certainty. Some One Society therefore teaches it, For more than <hi>One</hi> (if diuided in faith) cannot, This <hi>One</hi> muſt be Signali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and pointed out, which no Proteſtant can do, For if he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me his own Church he hath the whole world againſt him, and will be forced to proue his Aſſertion vpon indubitable Principles: And if he point at the Roman Catholick Church, he ruin's his own cauſe, For two oppoſite Churches cannot teach Doctrin morally Certain. Now if he can point at no Church of One Denomination teaching Doctrin Morally certain, This <hi>certainty</hi> is only an inſignificant word in the aire, appliable to no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Society.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. A ſecond obiection. The Motiues of Credibility though commonly held only Inducements morally certain, ſo Denote the true Church, that all may find it out, Therefore though Church Doctrin were only morally Certain, and not Infallible, it may ſufficiently lead to belieue that Doctrin which God has Reuealed. Anſw. Here is neither Parity nor any Inference conſequential,<note place="margin">Faith relies not vpon Motiues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to Beliefe.</note> And the want of diſtinguishing between the <hi>Credibility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> of Reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Doctrin and its Truth, breed's the Confuſion. The Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues then only make the Doctrin <hi>euidently Credible,</hi> and remit vs to the Church which teaches Truth, She propoſes the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, and vpon Her Propoſition Faith relies, which therefore
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:102688:231"/> muſt be infallible, not vpon the Motiues too weak to Support Faith. In à word here is all I would ſay. God Reueal's truth infallibly, the Motiues in à General way manifeſt the Church where truth is taught, the Church thus Signalized Propoſes Truth infallibly, And vpon Her infallible Propoſition (not for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) Chriſtians belieue Infallibly.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. A third Obiection. If the Churches Propoſition be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or if God ſpeaks by the Church As he anciently did by the Prophets and Apoſtles, And She likewiſe Speak's in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Whateuer this Oracle Propoſes may be called the Voice of God, and Conſequently the Formal Obiect of Faith. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer no hurt at all were it ſo, For perhaps in this preſent State of things, few Articles of Faith are, or can be belieued indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of the Churches Propoſition. At leaſt it is very eaſy to ſay. <hi>I Belieue the Sacred Trinity becauſe God anciently Reuealed it to</hi>
                     <note place="margin">whether the Churches Propoſition may be Call'd the Obiect of Faith?</note> 
                     <hi>the Apoſtles, and alſo becauſe the Church now Testifies that the Myſtery was anciently Reuealed.</hi> Howeuer we here waue this Doctrin and Say. The Churches Propoſition, though abſolutely infallible, is not properly ſpeaking the Formal Obiect of Faith, Though much may be <hi>de Nomine.</hi> Firſt, becauſe it is meerly Accidental, not Eſſential to Faith, to be propoſed by the Church, by this, or that Oracle, For Chriſt our Lord at his firſt Preaching was not the Church, yet he Propoſed Articles to be Belieued, and moſt Infallibly. 2. Diuines by the word <hi>Formal Obiect,</hi> vſually vnderſtand the Ancient infallible Reuelation made to the Prophets and Apoſtles, And not the Churches Propoſition, which though it be an Intrinſick, Eſſential, and Neceſſary Condition <hi>complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> and <hi>Applying</hi> the Ancient Reuelation to Belieuers, yet Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally it Terminates not Faith. Now to be an eſſential Condition, nothing at all impairs the Churches Infallibility. Thus much is ſaid to ſolue the Obiection, though the Matter, t'is true, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of higher Speculation, but Sectaries like not Speculatiue Learning.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. A fourth Obiection. The Churches Infallibility ſeem's chiefly Aſſerted vpon this Ground, that She is to be Heard, and
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:102688:231"/> Obeyed, which proues nothing. For Iudges, Gouernours, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents<note place="margin">The Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between Gouernours Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining.</note> are to be heard and obeyed, though all are fallible. Anſw. A moſt ſilly Obiection. The very Matter, wherein Theſe and the Church are to be Obeyed Shewes the diſparity, For No Ciuil Magiſtrate pretend's to regulate Faith, or to Define what God Reueal's. This the Church, and She only is impowred to do, To crush Hereſies as they riſe vp, and to eſtablish without Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the contrary Truths, which cannot be effected (the matter being ſo Sublime) without the infallible Aſsiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt. Now we are to Proceed to the main Buſineſs in hand.</p>

Thus much Premiſed, here is my Aſſertion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Roman Catholick Church is Gods infallible liuing<note place="margin">The Roman Catholick Church is Gods Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Oracle.</note> Oracle, and teaches not only Chriſts <hi>true</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> Doctrin, But moreouer Deliuers it ſo infallibly that She cannot err. The Proof of the Aſſertion wholly depend's vpon à Diſcourſe in the other Treatiſe. <hi>Diſc. 1. C.</hi> 2. and in the Appendix. <hi>P.</hi> 2. 3. 4. Whence I Argue. If once you annul this one Principle, that à Church which pretend's to teach Chriſts Sacred Doctrin, teaches it ſo fallibly that She may Deceiue, it doth not only follow that one Eminent Perfection in our Sauiours Preaching (who taught infallibly) is vtterly loſt, and now remoued from vs, But this is alſo conſequent, That no man can haue aſſurance of ſo much as of one Chriſtian Verity at this day Propoſed or taught the whole world ouer. The Reaſon is. Whateuer Church teaches Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrin fallibly, can ſay no more but thus much timidly, That (<hi>as taught</hi>) it may by <hi>virtue of the Propoſition</hi> be falſe, but à Doctrin ſo far remoued from infallible Certainty for want of à due Application of its Infallibility, comes not neer to the Doctrin<note place="margin">The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proued.</note> of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which was Applyed, Taught, and. Propoſed <hi>Infallibly.</hi> Therefore ſuch à Doctrin if valued by the merit of its <hi>Deliuery,</hi> Can be eſteemed no more but à weak vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain humane perſwaſion, not at all reſoluable into God's infallible Verity. For though God own's à Doctrin obiectiuely True, and <hi>Infallible</hi> (becauſe he Reueals it) yet he vtterly disowns ſuch à Propoſal as diſcountenances <hi>that VVorth,</hi> and makes it look like à changling, or diſlike it Self, (That is) neither True, nor <hi>Infallible,</hi> but contrarywiſe <hi>Poſsibly falſe and fallible.</hi> And it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor can be more to Chriſtians than fallible, <hi>if propoſed Fallibly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Caſe is thus, As if one had à Gem of mighty Value,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:102688:233"/> and skilful Iewellers were appointed to Priſe it, yet none after all Art and Induſtry vſed can know the true worth Thereof.<note place="margin">An Inſtance</note> The Iewel may indeed be precious, and perhaps not. More the moſt skilful cannot Say. Put this caſe, the Owner would be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enriched by ſuch an vnknown treaſure whilſt the worth is not known. And no More Say I, are Chriſtians now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with Chriſts Precious Verities, whilſt none can eſteeme of Their vltimate Value nor Say <hi>infallibly,</hi> They are Gods own infallible Truths? Moral certainty has here no place, For the Reaſons alleged aboue. Hence it followes, That as God Reueal's his verities of an Immenſe Valuation (<hi>True</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi>) So Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has ordained that they be Propoſed anſwerably to their due Eſtimate, <hi>truly,</hi> and <hi>infallibly,</hi> without which Their vnfitnes to ground Faith is more than palpable, as will appear by the Reſoluing any one act now held <hi>de Fide.</hi> Pleaſe to obſerue. We and Sectaries belieue the Diuine word Conſubſtantial to his<note place="margin">The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion further declared.</note> Father, the Church Propoſes that infallible Truth, but as it is now Suppoſed, <hi>Fallibly,</hi> the Aſſent which followes vpon that Propoſition and should be Diuine, reaches not ſo high, becauſe it Anſwers not to the Strength of the infallible obiectiue Verity in it Self (yet not aſſerted by any, as infallible) But to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the <hi>formal Propoſition,</hi> which is ſuppoſed ſo fallible that it may be falſe. All then that à Belieuer can Say by virtue of that weak Light is thus much only, and no more. <hi>Perhaps the Diuine word is Conſubſtantial, perhaps not,</hi> For none doth or can auen the Truth otherwiſe, but as à thing doubtful or indifferent to truth and falshood.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Reaſon à <hi>Priori</hi> of all now ſaid is. We neither know, nor belieue by external <hi>Obiectiue Truths</hi> conſidered in Themſelues, but by our own <hi>Subiectiue internal</hi> Acts, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Obiectiue Truth appears in our own internal Acts, of ſo much worth it is to vs, And neither more nor leſs. Now further. My internal Faith neceſſarily depend's on two external Obiects when I belieue any Myſtery: The firſt is <hi>Gods Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> The other the <hi>Churches Propoſition:</hi> Neither the one or
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:102688:233"/> other is my true Faith, for that's inherent in me, if I belieue.<note place="margin">We belieue not by Obiects but by our int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Acts.</note> When therefore the Church after Her Propoſition obliges me to Settle my internal Faith vpon the Diuine Reuelation, I rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demand in what manner, Or how I shall fix it? Knowing well, if God ſpeaks he ſpeak's infallibly, But my Scruple is whether the Church can infallibly Aſſure me ſo much? If She Anſwer's tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly She doth ſo, I am ſecure vpon this Principle, that an Oracle teaches which cannot Deceiue. But if it be replyed, She is only impowred to Propoſe reuealed Truths <hi>fallibly,</hi> and I by my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Aſſent cloſe, as it were, with <hi>That,</hi> or lay hold of the reuealed obiect iuſt ſo as it is propoſed <hi>fallibly,</hi> moſt euidently my Aſſent and Belief, is no more but Fallible.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In this Matter then as in all others, we are exactly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Propoſal of Obiects, for as they are laid forth to vs, ſo much weight they haue. For example. A real Good in it Selfe is by miſtake Propoſed to me as an Euil, I adhere to that Obiect as it is propoſed, and muſt Adhere to Euil, becauſe it appear's ſo to me. In like manner, an infallible Truth, is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not as it is in it Selfe, <hi>infallible,</hi> But diſcoloured, and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by à viciated Propoſition which is fallible; Therefore by force of that weak Declaration it appear's no other to me but<note place="margin">As things are propoſed ſo they are to all that belieue.</note> weak and fallible: And none on earth can vnbeguile me, or Propoſe it with greater certainty, Becauſe all are now Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fallible in their Teaching.</p>
               <p n="8">8. One Inſtance may yet clear my meaning. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reads Chriſts Sacred words. <hi>Matt. 26. This is my Body.</hi> And Propoſes what he conceiues to be belieuable by Faith, But<note place="margin">An Inſtance</note> doth it fallibly. Imagin that the Roman Catholick Church alſo could Say no more for Her Doctrin, or the Senſe of thoſe Words, But as the Proteſtant doth ſo fallibly that all might be Falſe, it is clear That none, whether Catholick or Proteſtant, can haue Certainty of the Doctrin, which Chriſt our Lord deliuered in that one short Sentence. Why? Both declare their fallible Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents only and <hi>Fallibly</hi> concerning the Sacrament, So far their teaching reaches and not farther. Therefore the Faith which
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:102688:234"/> should be had of the Myſtery dwindles into nothing but into à fallible Opinion, by virtue of that imperfect Teaching.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Hence we learn, that à Doctrin though infallible in Gods word without more Help, makes no man (though he be à Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy of wit) an Infallible Teacher. The reaſon is. Infallibility<note place="margin">Scripture alone makes no man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. And why?</note> Proceed's not from Scripture <hi>eaſily</hi> miſinterpreted, but immediatly from Gods ſpecial Aſſiſtance, And this Aſsiſtance which fixes an Aſſumed Oracle vpon Truth <hi>vnerrably,</hi> no malice can wreſt to falshood. Now that the Book of Scripture as dayly Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teaches, is horridly peruerted to à Siniſter ſenſe, needs no proof, For all know, what ruin Hereticks haue (to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their Power) endeuoured to make of the chief Articles of our Chriſtian Faith, though they aknowledged Scripture to be God's Diuine Word. There is ſcarce One which remain's Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peruerted. Some Deny the Neceſſity of <hi>Diuine Grace,</hi> Others, that great Myſtery of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> Others an <hi>Equality in the Diuine Perſons,</hi> Others our Sauiours two Wills, Diuine, and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. Thus the Pelagians, the Antitrinitarians the Apollinarians and Monothelits taught and deceiued The world. And when Scripture is Alleged in behalf of euery Orthodox Truth, All you haue from them is à return of ouerthwart Gloſſes. <hi>Grace,</hi> muſt ſignify what the Pelagians pleaſe, <hi>The VVord made Flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How abuſed.</note> what the Antitrinitarians fancy, and ſo of the reſt. Whence it is Euident that Scripture <hi>Alone</hi> without more light, clears not ſufficiently its own Truths, For here you Se the moſt Primary Atticles diſowned and Conſequently Scripture abuſed by Priuate Spirits, which therefore makes none infallibly certain of God's reuealed Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We Catholicks require à further Help, One faithful Oracle to teach, which in this conteſt about the Senſe of Gods<note place="margin">What Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire beſides the bare—Letter of Scripture.</note> Word end's all Strife, and Saies both plainly and infallibly. <hi>Thus and thus an Infinite Verity ſpeaks</hi> in Scripture: Yet Sectaries are offended with vs, becauſe we can aſſert without heſitancy. <hi>VVe belieue infallibly what Truth it Selfe Reueal's infallibly:</hi> Nay more, They are angry with God for hauing done them the greateſt

For to put à Period to theſe endles<note place="margin">A ſignal Mercy of God makes ſectaries offended.</note> debates raiſed among Chriſtians, To teach all Infallibly by his own vnerring Oracle what may and ought to be belieued Infallibly, is à ſignal Mercy for which due Thanks can neuer be rendred. Diſowne the Mercy, we liue and shall liue, in à Spirit of Contention to the worlds end.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Now if you Ask why the Church, after She has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Senſe and verity of Scripture, more eaſily beget's infallible Faith in Her Children, Than the bare letter of Gods word can doe without Her? I Anſwer. The facility (Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine aſſiſtance Suppoſed) ariſes from the Clarity of Her tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching known to all Vniuerſally, whether Orthodox or others. Whence it is, that few of our Aduerſaries ſcarce moue any doubt concerning the Senſe of the Churches vniuerſal receiued Doctrin (for that's plain) but chiefly Queſtion the Truth of it. Whereas all is contrary in our conteſt with the forenamed Hereticks, For there is no Diſpute whether Scripture be true,<note place="margin">What is chiefly debated with Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> The debate only being what it Saith, or what the Senſe of Gods ſacred word is? Here we fight in darkneſs before the Church Speak's and Declares Her Senſe, And if She be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely Aſſiſted to teach truth, as is already and shall be more amply proued in the ſequele Diſcourſe, that doubt alſo ceaſes, and vanishes into nothing.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In the mean while, Some may Object. 1. The greateſt part of Chriſtian Doctrin is now agreed on, and Suppoſed by Catholicks and Proteſtanss both true and infallible, what neceſſity then haue we of any other Oracle beſides Scripture, to teach infallibly? Anſw. The Agreement is Null, and the Suppoſition deſtroies it ſelf, if all that taught Chriſtian Doctrin ſince the Apoſtles time teach it fallibly, For How could any<note place="margin">An Obiection Anſwered.</note> agree in this, That ſuch and ſuch à Doctrin is both true and infallible, when He, or They (yea all) that teach may, becauſe fallible, erre in their very teaching, and call that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Doctrin, without Aſſurance giuen of its Infallibility? Do Therefore all own the Verities in Scripture infallible (not
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:102688:235"/> infallible <hi>ex Terminis</hi>) We muſt ioyntly own with that, an Oracle which Propoſes theſe Verities <hi>infallibly,</hi> or can belieue nothing. And by this you Se the Suppoſition deſtroies it Selfe, For<note place="margin">The Sectaries Suppoſition destroyes it ſelfe.</note> to Suppoſe à Doctrin infallible, when none can Propoſe it anſwerably to its Merit, as <hi>infallible,</hi> or <hi>infallibly,</hi> is as implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, as to Suppoſe without Proof, the Starrs in Heauen equal in number, and from thence to Inferr they are to be iudged equal. The Parity holds exactly.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Obiect. 2. Whoeuer, though fallible, Deliuers by chance Infallible Chriſtian Doctrin, Teaches the very ſence that Chriſt taught. Anſw: Very true. But he giues no Aſſurance<note place="margin">Aunother Errour of Sectaries.</note> That he doth ſo, For à fallible Deliuery of à Truth, as yet only Suppoſed not Proued infallible, raiſes it no higher but to ſuch à State of Vncertainty, that one may iuſtly doubt whether it be Chriſt's infallible Doctrin or no.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Obiect. 3. The fallible teaching of an infallible Verity may well conuey vnto à Hearer that which God has Reuealed. For why may not an infallible Verity, <hi>as Reuealed,</hi> though <hi>fallibly Propoſed</hi> haue influence vpon Faith, and work in Belieuers à moſt firm Aſſent? Anſw. It is vtterly vmpoſſible; For à fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible teaching of an infallible Verity not yet Propoſed as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible by any, neither Suppoſes the Truth <hi>Certain</hi> vpon <hi>other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> (and this is euer to be noted) <hi>nor makes it infallible.</hi> It Suppoſes no Truth <hi>taught</hi> infalliby, for Proteſtants Say None now can teach ſo, All Doctors being fallible: And moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently<note place="margin">Sectaries clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced.</note> it makes not that Verity infallible, For <hi>the Verity</hi> (as reuealed) <hi>was antecedently Infallible before this fallible teaching medled with</hi> it, Which therefore can not make it Infallible. By what is ſaid, you ſe our Sectaries Suppoſition of ſome Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin acknowledged infallible is pure Sophiſtry, for none can Aſſure them ſo much, if All that teach it be fallible. The very Apoſtolical Doctrin reſpectiuely to vs now liuing loſes i'ts Infallibility, if this Suppoſition ſtands, That all Teachers are fallible. Now we Proceed to à Second Argument and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thus.</p>

                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:102688:235"/>15.

The Euil here hinted at is ſo Notoriouſly horrid, the Perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it cauſes ſo Great, that either Church Doctrin vnauoydably becomes deſpicable, (whilſt euery one may iuſtly Quarrel with it) Or this Principle muſt ſtand vnshaken, that the Church cannot teach à Falshood.</p>
               <p n="16">16.

It is clear, that euery Doctrin Taught ſince the Apoſtles time has been deliuered <hi>Fallibly,</hi> Tis clear likewiſe, All that teach it at this day (highly diſſenting among them ſelues) Teach fallibly, Imagin now that two aduerſe Parties, Ten learned Proteſtants on the one Side, And as many learned Catholicks on the Other, meet together and ſeriouſly Diſcuſs this Point, whether Proteſtancy or Catholick Doctrin (as oppoſed to Proteſtancy) be the true Religion? (the like is if any particular Controuerſy fall vnder Debate.) I ſay the Attempt to decide any one controuerted matter is Vain and Impoſſible, if both Church and Councils be Suppoſed fallible, And conſequently Mr. Stillingfleets <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> are no more but meer inſignificant Words. The Reaſon is. Whilſt fallible men pIead for Religion vpon Principles as fallible as they are that Argue, the Reſult of that Diſpute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily carried on by Arguments and reaſoning purely fallible, can end in nothing but in diſſatisfactory Topicks, if yet it come ſo far. But this is ſo, and obſerue well. The Proteſtant plead's<note place="margin">The weaknes of two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties pleading fallibly.</note> for his Tenents, or oppugn's our Doctrin and doth it fallibly: The Catholick Anſwers, and fallibly too; The Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, but hath no infallible Principle to ground his Reply vpon, no more hath the Catholick, if the Suppoſition hold's, any other Anſwer but what's Vngrounded, and Fallible.

Or ſo much as the Truth we all ſeek for yet diſcouered in this weak skirmish, Whilſt Fallible men, and Fallible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and Fallible Principles are the only Support of the whole Diſcourſe? Moſt euidently no. All are left where they were before in à deep Perplexity.</p>
               <p n="19">19.

               <p n="20">20. Some may Reply. The grand Principle of Proteſtants,<note place="margin">The grand Principle of Proteſtants, reiected,</note> is, that Scripture in things neceſſary to Saluation, appeares plain to all who vſe ordinary Diligence to vnderſtand it, wherein cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly their <hi>Truth and Reaſon</hi> may be found. Contra. And I Preſs not in this place the Vncertainty of the Principle, which is as diſputable as any other Proteſtant Tenet, But Say more, it is wholly improbable, Yea and deſtroies Proteſtancy. It is<note place="margin">And why?</note> improbable, Becauſe it cannot be Suppoſed that any priuate man or men, haue vſed full Diligence to vnderſtand the Scriptures Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:102688:237"/> And that à Church of à thouſand years ſtanding hath neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted à Duty ſo neceſſary. But theſe priuate men whether Arians, Proteſtants, or Socinians, and the Church draw contradictory Senſes from Scripture, And all theſe iarring Sectaries with their different Senſes defend not truth, Therefore ſome of them (let the fault yet light where you will) haue not vſed Diligence, nor righly vnderſtood God's word. The Queſtion now is (and ſome Oracle muſt decide it) where, or in whom, this Misunderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding lies? Moſt willingly would I haue this one Difficulty folued and t'is worth the Labour, whilft euery one See's it is no more certain, that the Proteſtant hitt's on the Scriptures true Senſe, <hi>than it is certain that the whole Church after à thouſand years Diligence, miſtakes it.</hi> Can this think ye be euer cleared in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half<note place="margin">VVhy Should Sectaries his right on the Scriptures Senſe.</note> of Proteſtants by any Proof, ſo much as meanly Probable? It is Impoſſible. Wherefore I Conclude, Their Grand Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is rotten at the very root, fail's all that Rely on it. I will ſay it once more. If the Proteſtant hath no greater Certainty of his Senſe of Scripture than it is certain, That he hitts right, and the Church Err's in her Senſe, His Belief after all induſtry<note place="margin">And the Church be deluded?</note> vſed ſtands vnprincipled, reſts on his own fancy, and is not recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, <hi>while he iudges ſo.</hi> Say the very vtmoſt it is no more but à meer hazard, whether he belieues, or no, and this deſtroies Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy. Thus much of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The next thing pleadable in behalf of Mr Stillingfleets <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> may perhaps be the Authority of Holy Fathers. It is weightles if the Church be fallible, or has Erred. And firſt Proteſtants ſay all Fathers are liable to Errour. I add more and Aſſert, if that Church whereof They were Members taught or can teach falſe Doctrin, it is à meer vanity to ſeek for certain <hi>Truth,</hi> or any ſatisfactory <hi>Reaſon</hi> in the Fathers Writings. What can Streams (the Fathers were no other) be Suppoſed pure, and<note place="margin">The Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries pretence to Fathers improbable</note> the Head fountain (Gods own Oracle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) Poyſoned and infected? Did they hit right vpon our Chriſtian Verities, when their only Guide (Chriſt's ſacred Spouſe) miſled Poſterity? Could they Dedicate all their Labours to make an Oracle renowned, that
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:102688:237"/> afterward whispered Errours into all mens ears? Theſe are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes. I Say then, it is à ſtronger and far more reaſonable Principle to Aſſert, That the Church neuer erred nor can erre, Than firſt to Suppoſe Her erroneous, And next to find truth in the Fathers, who were no more but Schollers, and ſuck't the milk of pureſt Doctrin from the Breſts of this their Mother, <hi>The Catholick Church;</hi> If She therefore poyſoned them with fals learning, both She and They yet poyſon vs; And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neither the Church, nor Fathers deſerue credit, nor can be prudently Belieued.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And here by the way I cannot but reflect vpon à ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge Procedure, vſual with Sectaries in All their Polemicks. Firſt<note place="margin">The proce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dure of Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable.</note> they Suppoſe the Church and Councils errable, yea actually miſled in Aſſerting <hi>Purgatory, Tranſubſtantiation</hi> &amp;c. And to Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify what is thought Amiſs, Some few Gleaning of Fathers (how little to the purpoſe is ſeen aboue) are produced, and theſe, Forſooth, muſt ſtand as it were in battail Array, fight againſt à whole Church, and ouerthrow Her Errours. Is this, think ye Reaſonable? Can it be imagined that God preſerued his Reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led truths in the Hearts thoughts, and words, of à few Fathers, and ſuffered his Vniuerſal Church, with ſo many learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils (conuened after the <hi>Four Firſt</hi>) to fall preſently into ſo sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meful à Dotage, as Sectaries charge vpon Her? Were the Fathers <hi>Then</hi> illuminated, and was the Church afterward darkened and beſotted? There is none ſo blind, But muſt needs ſe Himſelfe out of Countenance by aduenturing to Defend à Tenet ſo highly Contrary to all Reaſon. Wherefore I muſt earneſtly petition the Reader once more to reflect vpon the greateſt Folly which, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, euer entred the Thoughts of men. Thus it is. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue<note place="margin">To ſay the Fathers taught truth, and that che Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Truth</note> Fathers, (not many in number) Who wrote in the Firſt three or four Centuries in different Times and Places, (peruſed by few and vnderſtood by Fewer) are Suppoſed to Deliuer exactly the Catholick Verities, (What They ſayd was True) And an Ample Vniuerſal Church together with Her Learned Councils known to All; ſpread the whole world ouer for à Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

               <p n="23">23. The laſt Principle to ground <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> vpon, or to bring Controuerſies to an end, is Vniuerſal Tradition, but this alſo Fail's to vphold Truth, if the Church be fallible: For who will, or can with certainty truſt the Tradition of à Church (or ſo much as take the Book of Scripture from Her) were she branded with this foul Note of hauing Publickly taught, and wilfully impoſed à hundred Doctrins vpon Chriſtians contrary to Gods reuealed Reuealed Truths.

Again if Suppoſitions may once paſs for Proofs, I'll goe the Contrary way, and either Suppoſe all Councils infallible (or maintain this Truth: <hi>Errours cannot be euidently known</hi>) And why should not my Suppoſition, be as good as his?

And here the Diſpute begins again in behalf of what is Suppoſed, which can neuer be ended without an infallible Iudge.</p>
               <p n="28">28. It may be replyed. Theſe Aduerſaries proue not Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils fallible vpon any bare Suppoſition, but only Say thus much: If they were Fallible, the Peace of the Church may yet be Preſerued. Contra 1. Peace is infinitly better vpheld were Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils (as they truly are) owned Infallible, For ſo euery one would Acquieſe in their Decrees, as the Chriſtian world has done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. MR Stillingfleet to find out Euident and intolerable Errours in Councils Appeal's (as you Se) in the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:102688:242"/> next place to the <hi>Common Reaſon of mankind, and to the Conſent of wiſe and learned men.</hi> None could haue more ruined his own cauſe, For this Dilemma is vnanſwerable. The forementioned Councils haue either erred intolerably in Defining the Doctrins<note place="margin">A Dilemma</note> of <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> and of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> Or haue not erred into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably. If not; Proteſtants, as is now ſaid, are obliged by their own Law to yeild at leaſt external Obedience to them, which is not done, For herein they haue made à Publick Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and call ſuch Doctrins Errours. On the other ſide, if theſe Errours be intolerable you ſe by their own words, We muſt haue the Common Reaſon of mankind, the Conſent alſo of wiſe and learned men both ready to Oppoſe and Condemn them: But this is enormouſly improbable vpon à clear Ground. Do no more but Deuide the Moral Body of Chriſtians now at Debate into two Claſſes, <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> For one that<note place="margin">Or à clear Conuiction of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> makes theſe Councils Illegal or their Doctrins intolerable, you haue hundreds, yea I think thouſands, who auouch the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and clear <hi>Both</hi> from that vnworthy Imputation. Therefore vnleſs Proteſtants engroſs the Gift of <hi>common Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to themſelues, and allow no little parcel of it either to the Greek or Latin Church, They are to recal what is Said: And if they will haue Reaſon ſo faſt intailed vpon à few Sectaries, That no body els can share in it, There is no further Diſpute: All we ſay is. <hi>God help Them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But what ſay we to Mr Hooker who tells vs neceſſary Reaſon or à Demonſtration <hi>is that, which being propoſed to any man and vnderstood, The mind cannot chuſe but inwardly Aſſent to it.</hi> I anſwer, the Principle, though good, is moſt impertinently Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the controuerſy now in hand, For haue not we (As is already noted) Thouſands and Thouſands in the Roman Church moſt learned and pious, who hear the Doctrins of the fore named Councils propoſed, and in Iudgement ſo inwardly Aſſent to all without ſcruple, that they would dye for the verities the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<note place="margin">A Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</note> defined? The Truth is manifeſt. Therefore Mr Hookers neceſſary Reaſon, or Demonſtration has no place in theſe far
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:102688:242"/> more numerous than all the Proteſtants are in England, and conſequently euery man Stand's not euidently conuicted of our Councils Errours. Now if you ſay ſo many Thouſands are fool'd, Know Sr, That no few of theſe fools, are wiſe enough to diſpute with you, and to Show you Speak at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without Principles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus much is ſaid of our Catholick Councils hitherto conuened in the Chureh, now if we return to the old Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and Firſt imagin all Councils fallible, and Secondly thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, that the latter, of equal Authority amends the Firſt, or à Third the Errours of the Second, and ſo <hi>in Infinitum,</hi> I Say it is Impoſſible, either clearly to Diſcouer the pretended Errours, or to redreſs them, and this I Aſſert vpon theſe grounds.</p>
               <p n="4">4. One already hinted at, is, that none can by an inward Aſſent (aud Mr Hooker requires that) own any ſuch Euidence<note place="margin">An Aſſertion proued.</note> whilſt the Council which makes them Errours, is as weak and fallible as the other was that Defined the contrary, and Published all vnder the Notion of Chriſtian Truths. No more can I, were I yet to Learn reſt Satisfyed, in what either of theſe two iarring Councils Define (for the One is as bad as the Other) than I am able to truſt to two Miniſters Talk, if I heard them Preach quite contrary Doctrin at Pauls Church, That is, no man can belieue either, vpon their fallible Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

But Sectaries remit none to any liuing certain Oracle, Therefore they cannot but ſtill Sit in Darkneſs (T'is Gods iuſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon them) and blind as They are, lead the blind they know not whither.</p>

               <p n="10">10. I am verily perſwaded our Aduerſaries will think twice on't, before they once grant theſe horrid Conſequences, and therefore muſt needs make the Suppoſed Euident intolerable errours not altogether ſo abominable, but leſs, or of à lower rank, yet <hi>euident</hi> and <hi>intolerable. Remember that.</hi> And what may theſe<note place="margin">A queſtion propoſed to Sectaries.</note> be think ye?

               <p n="11">11.

               <p n="12">12. What Saith Mr Hooker? Is the mind ſo forced that after à full Propoſal, it cannot chuſe but inwardly Aſſent to All as euident Errours? Toyes. Trifles.

Will this be granted? Grant or deny, here is an vnanſwerable Dilemma; They are fundamental Errours (in our Sectaries ſenſe) deſtructive of Diuine Faith, or not. If not; but only ſmaller matters, Proteſtants Oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to forbear, and to expect the Churches Good pleaſure vntil, ſome other Council meet's, and Reuerſes what's Amiſs.

And T'is the chiefeſt thing I aime at. If Church and Councils be owned fallible, can err, or haue erred, Our Aduerſaries Suppoſition of Errours <hi>Euident,</hi> and <hi>intolerable,</hi> is purely chimerical, And therefore I ſaid iuſt now, None can know them as ſuch, and conſequently no Power on earth can amend them.

               <p n="9">9.

That theſe myſteries, as is now ſaid, haue both their Difficulty and Darkneſs. Natural reaſon left to it ſelf boggles at them, <hi>Iewes, Gentils,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> reiect the higheſt.

Thus the Arians diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now here I iuſtly appeal to the common Iudgement of Mankind, and Ask whether our God of truth, who on the one ſide perfectly comprehend's the depth of his own reuealed Myſteries, and on the other, penetrat's no leſs our shallow ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities (puzled as we ſe in the ſearch of the moſt Obuious things in nature) could make choiſe of men <hi>meerly fallible,</hi> and

               <p n="11">11. I ſay yet more. All the men in the world, conſidered meerly as nature has fram'd them, <hi>fallible,</hi> would commit the<note place="margin">Preſumption in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eaſily Committed.</note> Sin of Preſumption, and wrong both God and his verities, did they venture ſo far as to interpret Scripture by no other Rule or law but by their own weak Reaſon, and there vpon reſolutely define, that <hi>God is one pure Eſſence, and three real distinct Perſons: Original Sin is ſuch an euil as the Orthodox Church teaches: Children are to be Baptized</hi> &amp;c. To deduce thus much from the bare let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture, and to define euery particular reſolutely, is aboue the force of all natural knowledge. Thoſe then who Interpret the Truths of the firſt Alſeing Verity that inhabits light not ſeen by our natural eyes, muſt be ſpecially Priuiledged, and either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue<note place="margin">Diuine Aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> illumination from the Father of Light, or thankfully take infallible Aſſiſtance from the Holy Ghoſt the Spirit of Truth, which is both promiſed and readily giuen to the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Hence I deduce the Churches infallibility, and Argue thus. Either there is ſuch à Society of men preſerued by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence infallible in all they Define and interpret, or not.

               <p n="13">13. A few Queſtions will clear all, And firſt I muſt Demand. From whence has that we call Religion its truth? All An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from God the firſt vnerring Verity. Very right. But we Ask again, Where is the Maſter teaching Oracle which plainly deliuer's theſe reuealed truths, or clearly Propoſes the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries now named? Sectaries vſually tell vs, Their Oracle is holy Scripture. Herevpon followes à third Querie more difficult than all the reſt. Viz. Who Aſcertains you <hi>Arians,</hi> you <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> you <hi>Pelagians,</hi> you <hi>Proteſtants</hi> you <hi>Quakers</hi> (All fallible) that you<note place="margin">The Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries pretence to their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> rightly vnderſtand what you read, and groſly depraue not Gods Word, for without controuerſy innumerable called Chriſtians do depraue it? Proteſtants (à perfect Repreſentatiue of all the other) shall Anſwer for all. O ſay they, <hi>VVe read Scripture atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, we pray for light, we peruſe the Originals,</hi> we <hi>compare Paſſage with paſſage,</hi> and after much pains taken we both belieue the higheſt Myſteries, and moreouer perſwade our Selues, that the new Model of Proteſtancy is conformable, or (at leaſt) not Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to Gods word. Here you haue their laſt and very beſt Principle, For they will not hear of an Infallible Church.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Reflect Gentle Reader à little. Do Proteſtants only read, pray., peruſe, and compare? No Certainly. The Arians long ſince haue done So, yet boldly oppoſe Proteſtants, and deny the higheſt Myſteries of our Chriſtian Faith. If then the Arians <hi>Praying, peruſing,</hi> and <hi>comparing</hi> proue no conuiction to Proteſtants,<note place="margin">Arians alſo read, and Oppoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</note> Why should the Proteſtants praying or peruſing Conuince the Arians of Errour? Again. Haue not Catholicks (think ye) of à longer continuance and far more numerous than Sectaries, prayed and peruſed Scripture? None can doubt it. And yet they hold the whole Model of pure Proteſtancy à Nouelty, and openly declare it Heretical. Therefore vnleſs Sectaries ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<note place="margin">So do Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</note> à ſingular talent in praying and peruſing aboue all other Chriſtians, Vnleſs they can produce better Proofs for the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Faith againſt the Arians, and ſtronger Arguments againſt
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:102688:249"/> Catholicks in behalf of Proteſtancy, than the bare letter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Sectaries Pretence to reading Scripture.</note> And their own weak conferring Texts together, or praying vpon them, They do not only make Proteſtancy ridiculous, but moreouer, euery new whimſy defenſible; For was there euer yet Fanatique in the world that could not Say thus much? He certainly both profeſſes and teaches truth, becauſe he has à Bible, read's that, peruſes it and prayes earneſtly. And will not any Aduerſary retort the Argument vpon him and defend whateuer foolery he fancies contrary.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Belieue it, if this way of Arguing haue force the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Quaquer in England, will make his cauſe good againſt the<note place="margin">makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy ridiculous.</note> ſtouteſt Proteſtant, and the Proteſtant if he ſay. I <hi>read,</hi> I <hi>Ponder</hi> I <hi>pray,</hi> proues his Religion euery whit as ſtrongly againſt the Quaquer. That is, neither proues any thing. Nay more, the worſt of Hereticks, may vpon this ground maintain his Errours againſt the Orthodox Church (be that yet where you will) and could the Church <hi>only</hi> ſay, She reads Scripture, ponders it and prayes, Her caſe would be the ſame with the worſt of Hereticks, But beſides reading and praying There are other Proofs, whereby One Church only is euinced God's Faithful Oracle</p>
               <p n="16">16. From what is now ſaid I Argue firſt. A Principle, which makes falſe Religion true, yea all Religions though moſt erroneous as credible as true Religion, is more than intolerable.<note place="margin">The Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple makes falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions true.</note> But this Principle of Proteſtants, <hi>we read Scripture,</hi> we ponder and pray, makes falſe Religions true, and all Sects though moſt erroneous as credible as true Religion is, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is more than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. The <hi>Minor</hi> as is now ſaid proues it ſelf, For euery Heretick pretend's to read and ponder Scripture, but if you moue à further Queſtion concerning the Senſe of what he reads, he returns you his own fancy as the beſt light he has, and makes that his Iudge. This and no other is the Proteſtants Principle, and the chief, if not the only ſupport, of all Hereſy in the world.</p>
               <p n="17">17. I Argue. 2. And hold it à Demonſtration. To make Religion à Scepticiſm eternally debatable, without hope of
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:102688:250"/> attaining truth at laſt, is wholly as ridiculous, as if two men should goe to law meerly to wrangle, hopeles of euer hauing their cauſe determined. But this Proteſtant Principle. <hi>VVe read, Pray</hi> and <hi>ponder</hi> makes Religion à meer Scepticiſm without hope of euer knowing it, or hauing truth finally decided (<hi>Semper diſcentes they</hi>

                  <hi>are alwaies learning but neuer well taught</hi>). Ergo it is more than ridiculous.</p>
               <p n="18">18. To proue the <hi>Minor</hi> let vs firſt ſuppoſe, that either we Catholicks, or Proteſtants teach and profeſs true Religion (both certainly do not, for we hold Contradictions). Suppoſe. 2. This falſity, which our Aduerſaries will haue ſuppoſed. Viz. That the Roman Catholick Church after all Her reading, and peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Scripture is as fallible in all She teaches, as Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly are in what they deliuer after their reading. <hi>Both teach as they doe contrary Doctrin, Yea and fallible Doctrin, yet both tell you, they teach true Doctrin.</hi> Say I beſeech you, what man in his wits<note place="margin">To teach Contrary Doctrin and true Doctrin.</note> can belieue Either vpon their bare Aſſertions, chiefly if we Suppoſe them of equal Authority? when he find's the Reſult of their reading, and peruſing Scripture, to end in nothing but in open Contradictions, and ſees plainly that the oppoſit Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of the One Church, ſo much abates the Credit of the other teaching contrary, that in real truth both become Contemptible. And hence I Said, that which we call Chriſtian Religion would iuſtly deſerue Scorn, if no Church teach it infallibly. But<note place="margin">is impoſsible.</note> here is not all. To diſcouer more the groſs errour of Sectaries in this particular,</p>
               <p n="19">19. We are yet to Demand vpon whom this iarring Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of the two diſſenting Churches now ſuppoſed Fallible is to be laid? Or whence it proceeds? Can it come from Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial<note place="margin">A Doctrin taught fallibly.</note> Aſſiſtance think ye? It is impoſſible. Becauſe God teaches no contradictions. Nay, if we conſider it as contradictory, no Spirit of truth can teach it. Therefore we muſt part the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins, and Aſcribe to each Church its own particular Opinion, And then (were that poſſible) Examin which is true.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But here lies the Miſery. I ſay boldly. There neither
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:102688:250"/> is nor can be any appearance of certain reuealed truth in either<note place="margin">Proceed's not from God.</note> Church, not only becauſe all Principles fail whereby to diſcern à certain Chriſtian truth from Errour, but moſt vpon this ground, That we muſt now remoue the fallible taught Doctrins of both theſe Churches, from Gods <hi>Infallible Verity</hi> and his Special aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance alſo, and make them lean vpon mans weak and shallow vnderſtanding. We haue no other Principle to reſt on, if once infallible Aſſiſtance be excluded. But it is manifeſt, mans shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low<note place="margin">But relies vpon mans weak Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</note> capacity communicat's no Certainty to Any, concerning the high Myſteries of Faith, remoued from their Center (The firſt infallible Verity). Therefore all we can learn from ſuch Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, is no more but doubtful Doctrin at moſt, or, if it reach to an Opinion meanly probable, there is all, Yet you haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<note place="margin">No ground less then infallible Supports true Religion.</note> heard, (and it is à Truth) that no Principle leſs then one which is infallible, Can vphold our Chriſtian Doctrin. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore an vtter ruin of true Religion ineuitably followes vpon this Ground. <hi>As Duine Doctrin infallibly taught begets infallible Faith, So if taught doubtfully,</hi> it begets only à doubtful Aſſent, which is no Faith at all. Now were theſe Doctrins reſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely to each Church probable (as I think neither would be if the Suppoſition of their fallibillty ſtand's) we are only brought to the old Scepticiſm again, and may diſpute of Religion as we doe of Probabilities in Schools, and ſo if men pleaſe, They may as often change Religion as they change Opinions, or appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Some perhaps will reply. Proteſtants can certainly Say more for themſelues then only to tell you They read Scripture, and compare the Paſſages of it together by the light of their own weak reaſons, Could ſo much indeed make them accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished<note place="margin">Sectaries can pretend to no other Principle.</note> Doctors able to lay forth Gods eternal truths, it would ſeem ſtrange, mighty bare, and diſſatisfactory to Reaſon. Anſw. Here is all you haue from them, For they neither do, nor can pretend to more. Wherefore I challenge them again and again to Say plainly what other Principle can be relyed on, not wholly as doubtful, and as much controuerted as their very Religion
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:102688:251"/> is, when they either teach, or interpret Scripture, contrary to<note place="margin">But to their own Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> the Roman Catholick Church. Obſerue their Procedure. If à conteſt ariſes betwixt them and condemned Hereticks, The <hi>Arians</hi> for example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All ends in à meer throwing Texts at one another, And the ſenſe muſt be iuſt ſo as each Party conceiues. And do they not follow the ſame ſtrain in euery Controuerſy with Catholicks? One Inſtance will giue you ſufficient light, and may well ſerue for all.</p>
               <p n="22">22. They (Proteſtants I mean) read thoſe words of our Sauiour. <hi>This is my Body.</hi> So do Catholicks alſo. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Text with Text, and Senſe all as they pleaſe. Catholicks as wiſe and learned compare alſo, yet hold contrary Doctrin, and diſcouer no little fraud in theſe new mens Deductions, and Criticiſms. Say now plainly. Who is He that acts the<note place="margin">Sectaries ſeek to quarrel but to End nothing.</note> Sceptick's part? Who is He that would endleſly quarrel about the Senſe of Gods word? Is it the Catholick? No certainly. He is willing to haue the cauſe vltimately deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, He Petitions to haue theſe endles ſtrifes remitted to the cenſure of one Supreme Iudge, to à Church which manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth it ſelf by euident glorious Miracles (neuer yet cenſured, by any Chriſtians but known Hereticks) and which finally has taught the world euer ſince Chriſt left it. Dare Sectaries do thus much? Dare they appeal to any Orthodox Church, by whoſe iuſt Sentence theſe debates may haue an End? No. They recoyle, and without liſtening to any Iudge but Them ſelues, would ſtil continue theſe Debates. Therefore they are the Sceptiſts. And to proue this, giue me leaue to propoſe one Queſtion to the Proteſtant (He is the man we now treat<note place="margin">A Conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Proof of our Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> with). Has he any Church ſo free from Cenſure, of ſo long Continuance, ſo glorious in Miracles as the Roman Catholick is. Has He any Council as generally receiued the whole world ouer, as either the Lateran or Florentine which euer interpreted Chriſts words or Senſed them as he doth? Moſt euidently no. Therefore I ſaid well, His reading and gloſſes, and all he can Allege for himſelf, are nothing but His own
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:102688:251"/> weak thoughts, as far remoued from the foundation of truth, (<hi>Gods infallible Verity</hi>) as earth is from Heauen and more.</p>
               <p n="23">23. But its needles to Proſecute this Point further, when one only reaſon, which none can contradict giues Euidence enough againſt Proteſtants. I Propoſe it thus. What euer Doctrin they teach peculiar to Proteſtancy, or maintain againſt the Roman Catholick Church, either proceed's from Gods infallible <hi>Aſsiſtance,</hi> or wholly borrowes ſtrength from their own<note place="margin">Sectaries teach Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from Diuine Aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> fallible Conceptions, after their reading and comparing Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. Grant the firſt; They teach infallible Doctrin, by virtue of Gods infallible Aſſiſtance, and conſequently are the men who conſtitute an Infallible Church. Say ſecondly, that all they teach deriues force from their own weak reaſon (guided only by the external words of Scripture, vnderſtood as they conceiue,) They teach as the Arians, and all Hereticks haue taught before them, à learning which is not from God. Their<note place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not from God.</note> Doctrin in à word, Diuorced from all Diuine Aide and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, ſtand's tottering vpon their own errable Sentiments, and therefore neither is (which I intended to proue) Chriſt's Doctrin, nor at all reſoluable into that firſt Principle of truth, God's vnerring Verity.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Shall we to giue ſome clearer Light to the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy hitherto handled compendiouſly recapitulate à few of theſe many reflections made already in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? And then more eſtablish the Churches infallibility vpon vndoubted Principles. To do ſo, may perhaps benefit the Reader.</p>

This Diuine Doctrin is not only<note place="margin">A Church muſt be ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledged abſolutely infallible.</note> true and infallible in it ſelf, but moreouer ſo infallibly Propoſed by one vnerring Oracle, That all who will receiue it, are moſt indubitably certain of thoſe very truths which God has reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and therefore cannot err. Make good this one Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, We haue an infallible Church eſtablished, not only in à few nicknam'd vnknown fundamentals, but in euery Doctrin She teaches. Now the Proof is taken from the End of Diuine reuelation which ſeem's moſt Conuincing, For ſay I beſeech you, Why did God impart truth and infallible truth to the world? The end was not to improue his own knowledge, being euer <hi>Omniſcient.</hi> It was not that the Angels and bleſſed in Heauen should belieue, for Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ceaſeth in that happy State, All there ſe intuitiuely what they once belieued. The end the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore<note place="margin">The Proof is taken from the End of Diuine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation.</note> why God reuealed true and Infallible Doctrin was, That we, yet Pilgrims on earth walking by Faith should yeild Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it, and belieue all as both <hi>true</hi> and <hi>infallible.</hi> But this is impoſſible, if the Church which immediatly Propoſes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin can clash with Scripture or with Gods Reuelation, and peruert his Verities.

You will Anſwer, No, becauſe the ſame infinite verity which ſupport's truth, is powerful enough to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold alſo its infallibility. Say on I beſeech you.

But if you turn me off, with à fair Story of teaching truth, and Aſcertain me not of your teaching it infallibly, euery rational man will moſt iuſtly doubt of your teaching Truth.

If I be fob'd off with no man knowes what halfes of Diuine Doctrin, That is, if the Proponent parts truth from its infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and no Authority in Heauen or earth licences any to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate what God has ioyned together, I only learn the faint Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,<note place="margin">when We belieue God's reuealed Doctrin.</note> or weak Opinions of fallible Teachers founded vpon fancy, which God diſclaim's And (which is euer to be noted) man by nature fallible can do no more, but only propoſe them

Both haue à Body without life, words without ſenſe, difficulties propoſable concerning their reading, but none to Anſwer them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The only difference between them is; That the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, yet ignorant of Church and Tradition haue no Schoole to go to. Sectaries haue both, yet run as it were

And what haue you in lieu of this light, which hath hitherto illuminated Millions of Chriſtians? The weak and errable Sentiments of a few diſvnited Sectaries. And is this all we can rely on? Do we belieue the Trinity, the Incarnation and other high Myſteries (ſo obſcurely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Gods word, that innumerable haue miſtaken the true Senſe) becauſe à <hi>Luther,</hi> à <hi>Caluin,</hi> or their <hi>followers</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound<note place="margin">Whether Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers or an Ancient Church is to teach?</note> it? Or is our Belief grounded vpon that Churches Interpretation which has euer taught the world? The One or Other muſt haue influence vpon Faith, if we will belieue. But moſt manifeſtly the firſt (men only of yeſterday, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible) are not our Doctors, Therefore the Church is the only Oracle which Aſcertains vs of the Scriptures Senſe, of its Truth, and infallible Doctrin alſo.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Two things neceſſarily follow from this Diſcourſe. The one. That Proteſtants Shew themſelues ſtrangely vngrateful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">Sectaries manifestly vngrateful, And why?</note> they ſlight an Oracle, which has taught them all they know concerning the Primary Articles of Chriſtian Faith, for in real truth the Churches Authority in Her expounding Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpholds that true Aſſent they yeild to the Myſtery of the Sacred Trinity. So much is granted, Or not. Grant it. I Ask. Why diſdain they to hear this Church in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? If you deny. Their Submiſſion to this and the like Myſteries wholly relies vpon their own fallible diſſatisfactory thoughts and gloſſes.

                  <hi>What infallible Teſtimony haue you</hi> (he means Catholicks) <hi>for this, that Councils are Infallible? It is not</hi> enough <hi>for you to ſay, That the Testimonies of Scripture you produce are an Infallible Teſtimony for it: For that were to make the Scripture the ſole Iudge of this great Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy, which you deny to be the ſole Iudge of any.</hi> I firſt retort the Argument and Ask. What Teſtimony haue you Sectaries (I do not ſay Infallible) But ſo much as ſeemingly probable taken from Scripture, whereby Councils (the greateſt <hi>Repreſentatiues</hi> in God's Church) are made fallible? Not one can be alleged.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Now my Anſwer briefly is.

I firſt retort the Argument. An Act of Parlament, or à law made for all, receiues its force from the Conuened Members before his Maieſty Confirm's it, or not. If not; The whole Power of making ſuch à Law reſides in His Maieſty, which ſome will ſay is not ſo.

               <p n="20">20. The true Anſwer to the Obiection is as followes. Euery Doctrin definable may be conſidered two wayes, firſt as it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed's from God the moſt ſupreme Verity, and vnder that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is both true and infallible in it ſelf before the pope and Council Define it, (And note, they can Define no other Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin<note place="margin">And ſolued.</note> on earth, but what God ratifies in Heauen). 2. It may be conſidered as the Doctrin of the <hi>Repreſentatiue Church infallibly Aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi> to teach Diuine truths; And vnder that Notion it is called <hi>Church Doctrin,</hi> proceeding from the Head and Members of one myſtical Body: The Head therefore Separated or ſolely taken, Defines not in Councils, The Members diuided from the Head define not, But one and the ſame Definition proceed's ioyntly from both Head and members vnited together. The Inſtance already hinted at giues light enough. If any reply, The Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when the Council propoſed it, was both true and infallible Doctrin. I diſtinguish the Propoſition. It might be then Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note place="margin">Euery Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin true in it ſelfe, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Church Doctrin.</note> and infallible Doctrin in it ſelf (that's true) but as yet it is neither known or owned as ſuch or called Church Doctrin: It was then the whole <hi>Councils</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> true and infallible Doctrin, I deny it. This is founded vpon both Pope and

                  <hi>Let any man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>iudge whether this be not the moſt compendious way to ouerthrow the belief of Chriſtianity.

               <p n="3">3. It ſeems by what I read in Mr Stillingfleet T. C.

               <p n="3">3. I Say therefore firſt. The Argument propoſed if of any force, deſtroies all Faith euen the moſt Primitiue. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the Aſſertion I Ask, whether the firſt Chriſtians belieued
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:102688:262"/> infallibly the Infallible Teſtimony of the Apoſtles Preaching, with à Diuine Infallible Aſſent? Moſt certainly they Did. Yet the Infallibility of that Teſtimony was not known (if we ſpeak ſtrictly of Knowledge) but by Motiues of Credibility which were <hi>no Obiect of their Faith</hi> (vnleſs you make faith to be Science)<note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> but Inducements only to belieue. <hi>Ergo</hi> this very Primitiue Faith was vnreaſonable, becauſe it was an infallible Aſſent built vpon probable grounds, beyond all Proportion or degree of that Euidence, whereby thoſe pious men were moued to belieue. Hence You Se, though the Motiues which illuſtrate the Church were in themſelues fallible, and not Metaphyſically conexed with the Diuine Teſtimony, yet Faith grounded on that Teſtimony cannot but be certain and infallible, and conſequently muſt <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,</hi> or goe beyond all the degrees of Certitude appearing in the prerequired Motiues. Mr Stillingfleet reply's. <hi>This is to require Infallibility in the Concluſion, where the Premiſes are only probable.</hi> Anſw. He err's not knowing the nature of Faith, which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes not like to Science. For example. Make this Sillogiſm. <hi>Whateuer God reueal's is True, but God reueal's the Incarnation of the Diuine VVord, Ergo that is true.</hi> The difficulty only is in the <hi>Minor: But God reueal's,</hi> which cannot be <hi>proued</hi> by another belieued Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, wholly as obſcure to vs as the Incarnation is. I ſay <hi>proued by Reaſon,</hi> becauſe the ſame difficulty will be as much moued again Concerning the Proof of that ſecond belieued Article, as concerning the firſt of the Incarnation, and ſo <hi>in Infinitum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And Shew'd Proofles.</note> Therefore <hi>all rational Proofs</hi> auailing to beget <hi>Faith</hi> in any, muſt of neceſſity be extrinſecal to belief, and lie as it were in another Region more clear (yet leſs certain) than the reuealed Myſtery is, we aſſent to by Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now to our Purpoſe.

                     </gap>uidently Credible</hi> to reaſon, or Faith becomes vnreaſonable, and rash, For, <hi>Qui cito credit leuis eſt corde.</hi> Now further. None can proue this, by another Act or Article of Faith (no more its own Self-euidence than the belieued In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation<note place="margin">The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Proued.</note> is) All therefore which can be done, is to make it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Credible by Motiues extrinſecal to Belief, by vniuerſal Tradition, and the Conſent of innumerable learned men, who haue both conueyed vnto vs the Words as Diuine Scripture,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:102688:263"/> and the genuine Senſe of them alſo. But this very humane Tradition, this exteriour Conſent of all, or what other Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues can be Imagined preuious to Faith, (becauſe fallible,) may deceiue: Yet by the help of ſuch fallible Motiues Mr Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleets<note place="margin">Our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Clearly Conuinced.</note> Faith, if it reſt's vpon the Diuine Reuelation is raiſed higher, and ſtand's firmer vpon that Ground, than the Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of his Motiues can induce to. Therefore he makes the concluſion ſurer than the Premiſes, And goes beyond all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and degree of fallible Euidence, preambulatory to his certain Belief. What I Aſſert is manifeſt. For by Faith he<note place="margin">The Conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</note> Sayes the Incarnation is ſo infallibly true, that it cannot be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, Yet all the Motiues which induce him to belieue Say, <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly it may be falſe,</hi> or exclude not à Poſſibility of falshood. And if this be not to Tranſcend all Proportion of his acquired Euidence, nothing is to goe beyond it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Argument will be yet more clear if propoſed after this manner. Mr Stillingfleet infallibly belieues the truth of that Scripture now Quoted. I Ask by what means can he know That this very belieued Truth is à Diuine. Verity, or Scripture? The Anſwer may be, That's known vpon Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or the publique Authority of all, not only Chriſtians but others alſo, who haue conueyed the Book to vs. Very <note place="margin">Another moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing Proof.</note> good. But this Publick Authority, this Conueyance, or what euer Tradition you will, is either of equal infallible certainty with the <hi>Belieued Truth</hi> of Scripture, Or leſs and much weaker; If leſs and weaker, Mr Stillingfleets Faith goes beyond all propotion and degrees of his preuious acquired Euidence,<note place="margin">Not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> And it be of equal infallible Certaintly (That is) If he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieues as infallibly the <hi>Conueyance of thoſe Words, For,</hi> or <hi>Vpon</hi> Gods Diuine Teſtimony, as he belieues the <hi>Doctrin</hi> there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to be à Diuine Truth, He makes one Article of Faith the Proof of another, and euidently incurrs the Circle obiected to Catholicks, as shall appear afterward, When we examin his 170. <hi>Page,</hi> and refute his Errour concerning the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Certainty of Faith.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:102688:263"/>8. Now to the Obiection. <hi>It is not poſsible, That the Aſſent in matters of Faith riſe higher, or ſtand firmer than the Aſſent to the Teſtimony is, vpon which thoſe things are belieued.</hi> Anſwer. Very true. But know Sr, we Aſſent to matters of Faith vpon Gods Diuine Teſtimony, and not for the Motiues which only induce to belieue. So the Primitiue Chriſtians belieued vpon Chriſt's<note place="margin">A Miſtake in the Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> infallible Teſtimony, and built not their Faith vpon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Motiues Euident to Senſe, which meerly conſidered as <hi>Motiues only</hi> made his Teſtimony highly <hi>credible</hi> to Reaſon. Viz.<note place="margin">One Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce which none can boggle at.</note> That it was <hi>Diuine</hi> and <hi>infallible.</hi> For example. Some ſaw, Others heard of our ſauiours great Miracles, of his admirable Sanctity, And then diſcourſed. The Man that doth theſe wonders can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be one <hi>ſent from God.</hi> It is true, he preaches both new and difficult Doctrin to our eares, But if he be ſent from God, we are obliged to Belieue him vpon his word, And vpon that Word Their Faith relyed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Apply this Inſtance to the Church, you haue all I would Say. The Church is euidenced by Miracles, Sanctity of life in Millions, by Conuerſions and the like ſignal Motiues. Here are the Inducements which proue Her Gods Oracle, and<note place="margin">Clears all.</note> the Doctrin highly credible, aboue what euer all other Societies called Chriſtians haue Taught, Yet our Faith is not built vpon theſe Motiues conſidered as Inducements, but vpon Her infallible Teſtimony. The Inſtance now giuen Concerning the moſt Primitiue Belieuers is ſo clear, That our Aduerſaries shall neuer weaken the force of it, or shew the leaſt Diſparity.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And thus you ſe all Mr Stillingfleets talk. <hi>P.</hi> 113 Comes to nothing. <hi>I deſire</hi> Saith he to <hi>know, whether an infallible Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Infallibility of your Church can be grounded on thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of Credibility?</hi> Anſw. And I deſire to know whether an<note place="margin">A Question anſwered, and retorted.</note> Infallible Aſſent to the Apoſtles Preaching, was grounded on thoſe Motiues which the Primitiue Chriſtians ſaw or heard of before they belieued? what you ſay, I'll ſay. Briefly. Many learned Diuines hold the Motiues of Credibility Metaphyſically connexed with Gods diuine Teſtimony ſpeaking by the Church,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:102688:264"/> and if that opinion be true, the Motiues ground an Infallible<note place="margin">Shewed alſo impertinent.</note> Aſſent but <hi>that's Euidence,</hi> and <hi>no Faith,</hi> And therefore moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to your following Inference. <hi>If, ſay you, we affirm the Motiues ground an Infallible Aſſent, there can be no imaginable neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to make the Testimony of our Church infallible, in order to Diuine faith. For, we Catholicks, you hope will not deny, but that there are at leaſt equal Motiues of Credibility to proue the Diuine Authority of the Scriptures, as the infallibility of our Church, And if ſo, why may not an Infallible aſſent, be giuen to the Scriptures vpon thoſe Motiues of Credibility, as well as to our Churches infallibility?</hi> Anſw. A ſtrange kind of Argument.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Firſt, Sir, you know, or should know, Catholicks hold with <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> That no certainty can be had of Scripture without Church Authority (How then do you ſay, <hi>You hope we will not deny</hi> &amp;c). No Motiues as is proued aboue and in the other Treatiſe alſo, immediatly make Scripture Credible, independently of the Churches Tradition. No Miracles were euer heard of<note place="margin">No Motiues make Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly credible.</note> which proued the book of <hi>Ruth</hi> admitted by you, more Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scripture, than that of <hi>Iudith</hi> which you reiect.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WHat followes in Mr Stillingfleets. 3. or. 4 next Pages, ſeem's ſo ſlight that the very moſt is refuted by the grounds already eſtablished, Yet to Comply with the mans humour, we muſt follow him further.

                  <hi>that infallibility is attempted to be proued only by the motiues of Credibility?</hi> I Anſwer.

The Motiues are alike in both Caſes, if not greater for the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He Obiects. 2. <hi>If Diuine Faith, cannot be built vpon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues prouing the Doctrin of Christ, what ſenſe is there that it should be built vpon thoſe Motiues, which proue our Churches infallibility</hi> Here is the old Miſtake again. I Anſwer therefore. Diuine Faith is not built vpon the Motiues inducing to belieue, but vpon the Infallible Teſtimony of Chriſt, and his Church. The Motiues ground the <hi>Iudgement of Credibility,</hi> The Infallible <hi>Teſtimony</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port's<note place="margin">The ſecond is à groſs Miſtake.</note> Diuine Faith. Now if by this word, <hi>Built,</hi> you mean no more but rationally, <hi>To induce,</hi> I ſay none in this preſent State can be induced to belieue Chriſt's Doctrin reuealed in Scripture, in caſe he reiect's the Authority of that euidenced Church
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:102688:267"/> which both Aſcertains him of the Canon, and the Senſe alſo. Hence, That other Obiection fall's to nothing. <hi>How can there be an infallible Aſſent to the truth of this Propoſition: Scriptures are</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The third retorted, and anſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>the word of God, when that Infallibility at the highest is but euidently Credible?</hi> I Anſwer and retort the Argument. How could the Primitiue Chriſtians Aſſent to the Apoſtles preaching as <hi>infallible,</hi> when that <hi>infallibility</hi> at the higheſt, was but Euidently Credible, before they belieued?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The whole Confuſion lies, as is ſaid, in not Diſtinguishing between <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Iudgement of Credibility. Infallibility</hi> the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, whether we Aſſent to Chriſt, to his Apoſtles, or to the Church (all taught one and the ſame Doctrin) is the Obiect of Diuine Faith, but none euer aſſented to any Doctrin theſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles taught, <hi>infallibly,</hi> without ſufficient Euidence preuiouſly had<note place="margin">A Diſcouery of the whole Fallacy.</note> of its <hi>Credibility.</hi> And thus I belieue by Faith Scripture to be God's word, becauſe the Church Saith ſo, But if you Ask, why I hold all the Church Teaches to be <hi>Euidently Credible,</hi> I Euince not this truth by the <hi>Infallibility I belleue,</hi> But recurr to thoſe Motiues whereby She is proued an Oracle as euidently Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, as euer any Apoſtle was, And conſequently I belieue Her Infallibility with the ſame Diuine Faith, as I belieue the Words of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Page 114. He Obiect's. 3. <hi>We Catholicks make by this way of reſoluing Faith euery man's reaſon the only Iudge in the Choiſe of his Religion.</hi> Why doe we more ſo, I beſeech you, than the Primitiue Chriſtians, who certainly had the very like rational Motiues with ours, and no other, before they belieued? But of this Subiect we shall treat largely towards the End of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

               <p n="6">6. By the way I much wonder, Why Mr Stillingfleet omitted to touch here vpon an other Inſtance farr more difficult, which both he and all other muſt ſolue concerning rude and illiterate Perſons (chiefly if of no great maturity) who are induced to belieue by the Teſtimony, or Inſtruction of their Parents, or of<note place="margin">Another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance more difficult.</note> ſome other ſimple Teachers. Theſe certainly may haue Faith, without acquiring that full Euidence of Credibility whereunto the learned reach, yea, and without any Diſcouery of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures rational Euidence, neuer perhaps heard of, much leſs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now I Anſwer to the Obiection. None makes the Roman Catholick Church in all Circumſtances the only ſure foundation of Diuine Faith, For the firſt man that belieued in<note place="margin">The Church in all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eumstances was not the only Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith.</note> Chriſt our Lord before the Compleat Eſtablishment of His Church, had Perfect Faith reſting on that great Maſter of Truth, without dependance on the Chriſtian Church, For Chriſt alone was not the Church, But the ſupreme Head of it. Faith therefore in General requires no more, but only to rely vpon God the <hi>firſt Veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="496" facs="tcp:102688:268"/> and Miracles, which had been already wrought aboue the force of nature. Thus much Suppoſed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is hard I think for any to Say, where the force lies in<note place="margin">The Miſtake of the firſt Inſtance.</note> that Inſtance of the Apoſtles belieuing the Diuine <hi>Authority of the old Testament,</hi> which innumerable Iewes then diſperſed all Iury ouer, and the other parts of the world (not at all conſcious of Chriſt's Paſſion) moſt firmly belieued. Why therefore might not the Apoſtles belieue the Diuinity of the old Scripture vpon the Authority of that Church, whereof there were at that time many and very many Profeſſors in other places diſtant from Hieruſalem? Hence I ſay the Belief of that Article neuer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, But was alwayes preſerued entire in both Churches of the Iewes and Chriſtians, for we all yet belieue the Authority of the old Teſtament, And Conſequently its hard to Conceiue what this Obiection aymes at.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Again, admit à total Subuerſion of the Iewish Church, Had not the Apoſtles our Bleſſed Lord preſent who could well Aſcertain them that he came not to Cancel any Diuine<note place="margin">Suppoſed true its forceles.</note> Authority of Scripture (for this was impoſſible vnleſs God be contrary to God) but to fulfil, to perfect, and change the old Law into à better State. O but the High Prieſt and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders alſo erred in conſenting to Chriſts death. Very true, and the Reaſon is becauſe their Priuiledge of not erring, laſted only to Chriſt's comming and not longer, But hence it followes not, that then there was no Iewish Church which belieued the <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Verities of the old Scripture.</hi> I verily think, Mr Stillingfleet miſtook one Obiection for another. Perhaps he would haue ſaid, that the Apoſtles loſt faith of our Sauiours Reſurrection, at the time of his Paſſion, But this Difficulty is ſolued ouer<note place="margin">The Apoſtles failed not in Faith.</note> and ouer. Firſt it is Anſwered, that Article was not ſufficiently Propoſed to them, Therefore we read. <hi>Luke. 18. 34. They vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood none of theſe things.

If he Aſſent's becauſe they Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally conſent to the Myſtery, He build's his Faith not vpon God's Infallible Reuelation, but vpon the Aſſent of Others
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:102688:274"/> which He ſaith Should only be moral, and fallible. 3. Will<note place="margin">This preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded moral Certainty.</note> he belieue the Verity becauſe Heteredox Chriſtians Iudge it true? That's neither God's Reuelation, nor Chriſt's Doctrin, And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his Faith has no foundation. 4. Will he belieue for the Motiues of Credibility preuious to Faith? Theſe conſidered as Motiues, are nor God's Reuelation, Nor ſo much as Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Doctrin. Beſides as we Shall ſe preſently, Proteſtants haue no Motiues at all to rely on. Finally will He tell vs, He belieues that Chriſt was in the world and dyed on à Croſs, with the ſame Moral aſſent as He yeilds to the being of Caeſar and Pompey? I haue Anſwered, that's nothing to the Purpoſe, For Gentils aſſent to ſuch Matters of Fact (once Viſible and Senſible) by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<note place="margin">where the main diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty lies?</note> Certainty, And yet are Infidels. That therefore which vrgeth at preſent, Concern's the <hi>hidden and obſcure Mysteries of Faith,</hi> In the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Moral Certainty hath no place at all. The reaſon is manifeſt For if as reuealed they ſtand firm vpon God's infallible Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, No Power vnder Heauen can alter their own intrinſick Infallibility, Or Conuey them vnto vs vpon weak Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, yet Mr Stillingfleet boldly Aſſert's. <hi>There can be no greater Certainty then Moral, of the Main foundations of all Religion.</hi> Iudge good Reader, whether this be not à groſs Miſtake, And whether I wrong'd the man, when I told you his Diſcourſe is vndigeſted, and highly erroneous.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Yet we haue not ſaid all. Wherefore becauſe Mr Stillingfleet ſeem's highly to value This late inuented Nouelty of Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, we will examin the Doctrin moſt rigidly, till at las't the<note place="margin">Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty more rigidly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,</note> whole fallacy be diſcouered. To do this, my firſt demand is, to what Obiect will He apply his Moral Certainty in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact? <hi>Chriſt is the Meſsias truly God and man.</hi> Theſe four things and no more, can only be thought of. 1. The Matter belieued. 2. The Diuine Teſtimony, which reueal's that Truth. 3. The Faith of thoſe who belieue vpon Reuelation, And. 4. The Motiues whereby we are induced to belieue the Truth reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">Four things to be Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe God ſpeak's it.</hi> Now all know firſt, that in Material Obiects purely conſidered in themſelues, there neither is, nor
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:102688:274"/> can be moral Certainty, <hi>For euery thing is, or is not,</hi> independently of our Iudgements, where only Moral certainty is founded, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and all thoſe who ſe things intuitiuely, are exempted from this imperfect degree of Knowledge. 2. There can be no moral certainty in the Diuine Reuelation, which proceed's from an infinite Verity, for this without Queſtion is moſt Supereminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Infallible. 3. If that infallible Teſtimony, or Reuelation be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly<note place="margin">The efficacy of Diuine Reuelation.</note> applyed to Belieuers, and hath influence vpon their Faith, it cannot but transfuſe into it infallible Certainty, if <hi>God Speak's infallibly, for this end that we belieue him infallibly,</hi> And if Faith reſt not vpon that Perfection of his infallible Teſtimony, it <hi>is no Faith at all.</hi> Thus we Argued in the other Treatiſe. <hi>Diſc. 1.

               <p n="8">8. It remain's, that we now Say à word of the Motiues which<note place="margin">what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence The Motiues haue vpon Faith?</note> induce to Faith, and examin what Influence they haue ouer it, when we either belieue the <hi>Doctrin</hi> in Scripture, or the <hi>Churches Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Mr Stillingfleet. <hi>P.</hi> 203. Hauing firſt told vs, that <hi>the Reuelation which was communicated to one, was obligatory to all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it, though they could haue nothing but moral certainty for it,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thus. <hi>By this it appears, that when we now Speak of the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Faith, though the vtmoſt reaſon of our Aſſent be that Infallibility, which is ſuppoſed in the Diuine Testimony, yet the nearest and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Reſolution of it, is into the Grounds inducing vs to belieue, That ſuch</hi>

                  <hi>à teſtimony is truely Diuine, and the reſolution of this cannot be into any Diuine Teſtimony, without à proceſs in Infinitum.</hi> He would Say, That à true act of Faith relies vpon two foundations, one remote, <hi>the ſuppoſed Diuine Testimony,</hi> The other moſt proper and neareſt, To wit, the <hi>Grounds</hi> which induce to belieue, that fuch à Teſtimony is in being, or truely Diuine. And his reaſon (if he has any) muſt be, becauſe theſe grounds, immediatly Apply, or Conuey vnto vs the ſuppoſed Diuine Teſtimony. Now this Conueyance, or Application of the Teſtimony, being made by grounds only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally certain, It followes, that the Faith we elicit Anſwer's not to the <hi>ſtrength of the Teſtimonies</hi> Infallibility (conſidered in it ſelf) But to the <hi>weaknes of the Conueyance,</hi> and conſequently can be no more,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:102688:275"/> but only à Moral <hi>certain Faith,</hi> not at <hi>all Infallible.</hi> And thus you<note place="margin">remoues Faith from its own Obiect.</note> ſe, To lay Faith as low as may be, to remoue it from its own Center, and faſten it vpon no man knowes what moral ground's; Finally to introduce à new, weak, and vncouth way of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, is the beſt ſeruice Mr Stillingfleet can do for God and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.

               </p>
               <p n="9">9. I Say firſt. Proteſtants haue no grounds diſtinct from the Diuine Teſtimony, whereby to diſcouer any one particular Truth, which God has reuealed. I proue the Aſſertion. Theſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Grounds, are either reduced to the rational Euidence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, already refuted (as laid forth by Mr Stillingfleet) Or to the Doctrin contained in Scripture, And this Saith He. <hi>Page</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Doctrin refuted.</note> 170. <hi>VVe belieue by Faith vpon à Diuine Teſtimony,</hi> which therefore is not the antecedent Reaſon or ground, Why we belieue it, For no verity Aſſented to <hi>by Faith,</hi> can (as <hi>aſſented to</hi>) be the preuious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Aſſent, or à rational ground iuducing to belieue. Therefore we ſaid, our Sauiours Miracles <hi>belieued by Faith,</hi> when<note place="margin">Rational Inducements to Faith are euer preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Beliefe.</note> we read Scripture, are not the Inducements to belieue them, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe an Inducement to Faith, is euer preſuppoſed, and not inuolued <hi>in the Act of belieuing.</hi> But it is needles to Say more of this, For no man in his wits, if Queſtioned by either Iew or Gentil, why he belieues the Sacred Trinity, can for the laſt Anſwer tell him, He <hi>belieues ſo becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e belieues it,</hi> or becauſe he read's that Myſtery in à book called Scripture. Now beſides theſe proofles Inducements, there are no other imaginable, whereby the Diuine Teſtimony can be <hi>Diſcouered, conueyd, or applyed</hi> to Belieuers, but only thoſe known Catholick Motiues (as Miracles, Sanctity, Conuerſions<note place="margin">Church Motiues Slighted.</note> of Nations &amp;c) which illuſtrate the Vniuerſal Roman Church, And theſe Mr Stillingfleet ſcornfully call's, <hi>mute things, à grand Salad too often ſerued vp,</hi> found very dry and inſipid. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has no rational Inducement morally Certain for any one Article of Chriſtian Religion, much leſs for the Tenets of Proteſtants.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I Say. 2. If the Grounds or Motiues inducing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue (let theſe be what this Aduerſary pleaſes) haue Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:102688:275"/> connexion with the Diuine Teſtimony, or conuince vpon Metaphyſical Certitude that God ſpeak's the Truths we belieue, The Aſſent giuen to the Motiues is not moral, but highly infallible. Contrarywiſe, if all Motiues preuious<note place="margin">Faith cannot be built on Fallible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues.</note> to beliefe be ſuppoſed ſo fallible, that they may deceiue, Faith neither is, nor can be built vpon them, Therefore Mr Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet Err's in Saying. <hi>The neareſt and moſt proper Reſolution of Faith is into the Grounds, inducing to belieue, that ſuch à Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is Diuine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. To proue the Aſſertion, I demand, Whether God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges all to belieue his reuealed verities, vpon his vnerring Teſtimony, as the only <hi>Formal Obiect,</hi> or to belieue for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues extrinſecal to <hi>that Testimony,</hi> which though morally certain, may poſſibly Deceiue? Grant the firſt, Faith ſtand's faſt<note place="margin">The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proued.</note> vpon its own foundation, the Diuine Teſtimony. Say. 2. It is iointly built on Motiues, as the neareſt and moſt proper Obiect which in rigour may deceiue, it hangs, as it were, Vpon two <hi>Heterogeneal Principles,</hi> The One moſt firm <hi>and Infallible,</hi> The Other weak <hi>and fallible;</hi> Viz. Motiues which being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, cannot but contribute as much Weakneſs to Belief, as the infallible Teſtimony giues it Certainty, And ſo theſe two Principles, by their different Influence, Doe and Vndoe, build and deſtroy, wind on and wind off: The one imparts infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Certainty, the other ſtaikes it away, and makes Faith no more, but à fluctuating, moral, and fallible Aſſent.</p>
               <p n="12">12. To aduance this Proof yet further, I Ask Again (if all Diuine Reuelation were by à ſuppoſed Impoſſibility not infallible, but only morally certain,) whether then Chriſtians could belieue the reuealed Myſteries, with à Faith as certain, as they now elicite vpon Reuelation? Anſwer, <hi>Tea.</hi> That Perfection of infallibility, eſſential to Gods Reuelation, would then be vſeles and impertinent to Support Faith. Anſwer,<note place="margin">The Proof further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth.</note> 
                  <hi>No,</hi> or Say Faith, if the <hi>Hypotheſis ſtand's,</hi> would not be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and certain. I infer. Ergo, it is neither Diuine nor certain <hi>De facto.</hi> My reaſon is. So far, and not further, Gods
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:102688:276"/> infallible Teſtimony or the Diuine Reuelation has influence vpon Faith, as fallible motiues Apply it to Belieuers, or giue it leaue (might one ſpeak ſo) to Support that Aſſent, But theſe fallible Motiues, which immediatly apply the Reuelation to Belieuers, permit it not to raiſe that Act to any greater certitude, than only moral which may be falſe, Therefore the Reuelation <hi>de facto</hi> communicates no more Certainty to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, than if it were only morally, and not infallibly certain, For here is our Aduerſaries Principle. According to the Proofs and grounds, whereby we diſcouer the Diuine Teſtimony to be in <hi>Being,</hi> We belieue, But all theſe Proofs and grounds Say only <hi>Morally</hi> and <hi>Fallibly,</hi> that the Teſtimony is now in Being, Therefore faith alſo can be no more but only Moral, Fallible, and liable to Errour.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Hence it followes firſt, That neither the very Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of</note> nor any other Belieuers euer fince that time, had any ſurer faith than only moral, which may be falſe. It followes. 2. That the Truth of all Chriſtian Religion, inuolues in it à Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſalshood, For being applyed or propoſed to vs, vpon<note place="margin">Sectaries Doctrin.</note> grounds only fallible and moral, we are to iudge of it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Exigency</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> of ſuch weak grounds, And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore can eſteem it no better than fallible. It followes. 3. (And this I would haue noted) That Faith in theſe mens Principles, tend's not abſolutely into the Diuine Reuelation, but only with doubt and fear, or meerly <hi>conditionally.</hi> For euery man may rationally Say. Lord if you haue reuealed this truth. <hi>Chriſt is the true Meſsias.</hi> I belieue it as vndoubtedly true, but the certainty I haue thereof, is only Setled vpon Motiues which<note place="margin">They make Faith à Conditional Aſſent.</note> may deceiue me, Therefore my faith can be no more but Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical or conditional, to this Senſe. <hi>If you haue reuealed it, I belieue, if not I reiect it.</hi> Hence you ſe, it were much better (could not the difficulty be otherwiſe ſolued) to Say the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues preuious to Faith conuince with Metaphyſical certainty, that God ſpeak's by his Scripture and Church, Than to make the Reuelation ſo ſtrengthles that it can (becauſe weakned by
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:102688:276"/> fallible Motiues) contribute no other certainty to Belief, but what is Moral, and may be falſe.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And thus much Mr Stillingfleet, could he proced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently<note place="margin">This Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed's not Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> (as he doth not) should Aſſert. For, if (as he ſaith) conſidering the Nature of things, moral Certainty be as great, or beget's as firm an Aſſent as any Mathematical, or phyſical certainty, what is it that fright's the man from allowing Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible certainty to Faith? Or what gain's he to Subſtitute in Lieu of that, another certainty which he call's Moral? For if theſe two certainties be equally as ſtrong, it is Senleſs to eſtablish the One, and reiect the Other, but the truth is, in matters of beliefe, moral certitude has no place, as is largely proued aboue.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Againſt this Diſcourſe one may firſt Obiect. God can<note place="margin">An Obiection propoſed.</note> oblige all either to belieue what is reuealed, as <hi>infallible true to vs,</hi> So that there can be no poſſible Deception in our Belief. Or. 2. He may oblige vs to belieue His reuealed Verities meerly according to the efficacy of ſuch Proofs, as intimate to vs that God Speak's; And why may not Mr Stillingf. build his Faith vpon ſuch Grounds or motiues as the neareſt foundation, though the vltimate Principle of belieuing be the Diuine Reuelation? I haue partly Anſwered. Either thoſe Motiues conuince withall<note place="margin">Of no force if the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</note> Metaphyſical certitude, that the Reuelation doth actually Exiſt, and than the Difficulty ceaſeth, for the Aſſent yeilded to them, is infallible; Or contrarywiſe, They are as Mr Stillingfleet ſuppoſes, fallible, And may ſtand with all their Luſtre, though the Reuelation really were not in Being. Speak So; It is moſt clear, ſuch Motiues cannot ſupport Faith, For all which right reaſon can draw from them (if not abſolutely infallible) is thus much only, That our Chriſtian Verities according to Prudence,<note place="margin">If fallible, they vphold not Faith.</note> are euidently credible. But by virtue of that Iudgement we reach not as yet to the infallibility of the Diuine Teſtimony, Therefore if God obliges all <hi>de facto</hi> to ground Faith <hi>vpon his infallible Teſtimony which cannot deceiue, He iointly Obliges vs not to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The reaſon hereof.</note> 
                  <hi>ground it vpon fallible Motiues, which may deceiue,</hi> and ſtand as Mr
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:102688:277"/> Stillingfleet will haue it, although God had neuer reuealed any Chriſtian Verity. Again. If we are obliged to free Chriſtian Religion from all Poſſibility of falshood, That is, if God will haue vs to belieue it as abſolutely infallible, We cannot without wrong done to his infinite Verity Say, he obliges vs, to ſettle faith vpon Motiues only morally certain, or abſolutly fallible, for thus He would oblige vs to belieue that as <hi>his own Truth;</hi> which poſſibly may not be Truth, but contrarywiſe, à lie, à falshood, an Errour.</p>
               <p n="16">16. 2. Obiect: Now <hi>De facto,</hi> in this preſent State there is no Difficulty, For all iudge though the Motiues be fallible, yet<note place="margin">A ſecond Obiection Solued.</note> God has reuealed our Chriſtian verities. Anſw. All do not iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge ſo, But admit ſome do, They iudge ſo by their infallible Aſſent of Faith, terminated vpon the Verities as reuealed, But antecedently to to beliefe, none can iudge they are infallible reuealed truths, <hi>whilſt Motiues only fallible ground that Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe firſt Principle. God who is an Infinite verity and ſpeak's not to ſtones, can by à Diuine Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge proper to himſelfe, ſo make his interiour mind and ſincere<note place="margin">God's proper language</note> meaning known to rational creatures, that all vpon hearing His voyce may without heſitation indubitably, Say. <hi>Thus God Iudges, this be</hi> Speak's, which granted.

Then (and not otherwiſe) this external Language is certainly known to come from God, when it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his name, and ſo fairely appear's by its own Signatures, Luſtre, and Wonders, to proceed from him, That all muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs an infinite Goodnes cannot permit, either Diuel or falſe

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. From what is here hinted at, and the Principles already laid, I Diſcourſe farther. God can ſpeak to creatures in à Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage worthy himſelfe, and ſo proper to his own great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, that no falſe Prophet can forge, counterfeit, or perfectly imitate it. The Aſſertion ſeem's manifeſt, For if his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage be forgeable, or imitable by Enemies, It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judge by any Sign, whether he, or the Diuel ſpeaks. Nay, it followes clearly, that God Cannot ſpeak at all in à Language worthy himſelfe, or powerful enough to gain Belief, For if His voyce be not diſtinguishable from that of an Enemy, How Shall men yeild à ſurer Aſſent to God when He ſpeaks, than to an Impoſtor that ſpeak's like him?</p>

Thus much ſuppoſed, theſe two things follow ineuitably,<note place="margin">Church Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty Speak Something.</note> and in right Order. Firſt. Something is certainly ſignified by theſe Marks, and ſignal Motiues manifeſt in the Church, and conſequently they are either God's Voice, or the Diuels: Take which you will. If God's own Voice (for <hi>etiam factis loquitur Deus,</hi> Saith S. Auſtin) it is ſo clear and diſcernable by it ſelfe from another cogging Gypſie Language, that all may know it

Contrarywiſe, if you ſay The whole Aggregation of Motiues are à meer illuſory language of God's profeſſed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, you vndoe all, you deſtroy the Euidence of Chriſtianity, you annul our Sauiours moſt glorious Miracles, and render the Apoſtles admirable wonders, not only inſignificant, but contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to Iewes and Gentils. Let therefore the man appear in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick who dare boldly Aſſert. <hi>All the illuſtrious Motiues and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God either Speaks by them, or Christianity Perishes.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Catholick Church</hi> (which as I ſaid certainly ſignify ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) are the Language of Diuels, or falſe Prophets, when it is euident they induce to belieue à Doctrin moſt Pious and ſacred. If you Affirm, Chriſtianity goes to wrack. Say no, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſuch ſupernatural Signes to proceed from God, we haue enough, the very Luſtre of ithem ſo diſcountenances and abashes Hereſy that it appear's, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t truely is, in the higheſt meaſure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Hence we ſee (T'is the ſecond inference, and the chiefeſt thing I aym at) an inſeparable Connexion between theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural <hi>Signes,</hi> and the <hi>thing ſignified,</hi> I mean between the Motiues and the Diuine Reuelation: For if it be certain, that ſuch Signes<note place="margin">The Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion aſſerted followes: from hence.</note> proceed from God (which is indubitable, vnleſs either Diuel or falſe Prophet fourge them) None can doubt, but that God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Reuelation actually exiſt's, as the Motiues Morally Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, do Conuince.</p>
               <p n="9">9. You will Say, If the Motiues haue an Infallible Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion with Gods internal Reuelation, that very Reuelation, and Conſequently the Myſtery Reuealed, muſt alſo appear euident<note place="margin">Faith not Euident, though the Motiues haue an Eſſential Connexion.</note> 
                  <hi>in Themſelues,</hi> to all Belieuers, And ſo faith would be Euident. I deny the Conſequence, becauſe the Aſſent giuen to that Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, which implies the higheſt Moral certitude conceiuable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>degree of moſt ſtrict Euidence,</hi> is <hi>Science</hi> and not <hi>Faith,</hi> For it ſaies no more but thus much. The Diuine Reuelation, <hi>not ſeen in it Selfe,</hi> but only by the light of external Signs, is, by virtue of theſe Signes, made <hi>euidently Credible,</hi> Now this euidence, Faith,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:102688:297"/> 
                  <hi>as Faith</hi> leaues, Or laies aſide, And firmly adheres to the Diuine Reuelation <hi>only for it Selfe,</hi> as <hi>Contradistinct</hi> both from the Moral Euidence of the Motiues, and their apparent Connexion with the Reuelation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The reaſon is taken from the Notion of Faith, which es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially tend's obſcurely vpon its own Obiect, as the moſt ancient Fathers aſſert, whoſe words, becauſe known to Euery one, I waue at preſent, and will only mind you of what ſome Proteſtants teach. <hi>Faith,</hi> Saies one, <hi>and the Twi-light ſeem to agree in this Properly,</hi>

                  <hi>that à mixture of darkneſs is requiſite to both; with too refulgent light, the one vanishes into knowledge, as the other into day.</hi> Thus much granted, t'is clear, that no <hi>Euidence</hi> of the Teſtimony aſſented to, can moue to Faith, not only becauſe we should in the caſe of Euidence be neceſſitated to belieue, But vpon this account alſo, that the certitude of Faith, taken from the <hi>Supremeſt Verity,</hi> is of à higher Strain, and far ſurpaſſes all the certitude we find in Nature, or in the Motiues inducing to belieue: For were it poſſible, as it is not, that theſe Motiues, and all the preuious Proofs leading to Beliefe, could deceiue, it is yet more impoſſible, <hi>that God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi>

                  <hi>Veracity deceiues any.</hi> Now by Faith, we lay hold vpon this moſt <hi>Supreme,</hi> or, All-comprehending Infallibility <hi>proper to God</hi> alone, not communicable to any creature. And in this ſenſe, Faith far tranſcend's the Certitude of the forementioned Connexion, which is known to be Infallible by Natural Diſcourſe only.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It is true, The more euident theſe Motiues appear the better they induce to belieue, yet for that reaſon haue leſſe to doe with the very <hi>act of Faith,</hi> which as I ſayd, reſt's <hi>vpon,</hi> and laies claim <hi>to</hi> no lower à Verity then the moſt <hi>Pure and Supreme</hi> only, And if it reſt's not here, it is no Faith.

One may replie. The exteriour words of Scripture taken with the Diuine Teſtimony
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:102688:298"/> are Obiects of Faith, therefore theſe Motiues aſſented to vpon the ſame Teſtimony can, alſo terminate Faith, For we all belieue<note place="margin">The ſame thing known and belieued</note> that the Church is Holy and Vniuerſal.

Thus we know the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of God by the works manifeſt in nature, and withall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue it vpon his own ſole word, or the Diuine Teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Vpon theſe Principles we Anſwer to another Obiection. To belieue, Say ſome, is to truſt God whom we belieue, which<note place="margin">How we trust God by Faith.</note> is impoſſible, if his outward words, or exteriour Signes be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily connexed with his interiour ſpeaking. For how can we truſt, when an abſolute Aſſurance, is had of his Teſtimony? Anſw: This is done very eaſily, when the Aſſurance giuen is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal to the Teſtimony, and far inferiour to the Supereminent Infallibility of God that ſpeaks. Now this <hi>Motiue</hi> only, and no leſſer certitude ground's ſupernatural Faith. In à word we truſt, becauſe we tranſcend all created Certitude and rely vpon the moſt Supreme Verity, by an Obſcure Aſſent of Faith.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Others, Obiect. 3. We ſuppoſe all this while, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues inducing to belieue more perſwaſiue and efficacious, then<note place="margin">Church Motiues proued efficatious.</note> can be euinced by reaſon: For why may not God ſeparate the exteriour appearance of à Miracle from the reallity of it, And So permit the Diue I to delude vs all? I Anſwer. 1. This Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm firſt reuerſes the moſt glorious Miracles which Chriſt euer wrought. I Anſwer. 2.

               <p n="17">17. From what is Said, Two things follow. 1.

               <p n="18">18. The Queſtion therefore is?

               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="11">11. The Principle whereon this Doctrin relies, All muſt admit. Viz. That an act of Faith is wrought in à Soul hy<note place="margin">Faith à work of the Holy Ghoſt.</note> the operation of God's Spirit, and therefore the Holy Ghoſt muſt not be excluded from that work, which none can doe but He. Now what we Aſſert in this particular, is, that the infallible certainty of faith comes from this interiour Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as it more liuely ſet's forth the formal Obiect aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, or help's to à clearer Propoſal of the Diuine Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And thus in à word we haue the whole Progreſs of faith in this preſent State, explained. Firſt, à natural Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Myſteries precedes: This beget's à natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of their Credibility. After ſome conſideration, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re may ariſe an imperfect Iudgement of Credibility: But, should the <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore<note place="margin">The whole Procedure of Faith briefly laid forth.</note> the illuſtration or powerful Inuitation of Grace (by which, as I ſaid, the Obiect appear's another way and more clearly) is infuſed, whereof the ſoul is <hi>Recipient.</hi> The will now after other Preparatiues, thus ſtrengthn'd à new, command's boldly the vnderſtanding to Aſſent vpon the ſafeſt Principles imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Viz. Vpon God's infallible <hi>Reuelation accompanied with his own Diuine light,</hi> which makes Faith to grow higher in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, than all the Reaſon or knowledge in this life, can ariſe to. For as S. Thomas obſerues, Humane knowledge deriues its Certitude from Mans natural Reaſon, which may Err, but Faith has its infallibility, <hi>Ex lumine Diuinae ſcientiae</hi> from the light of<note place="margin">The efficacy of Diuine Light.</note> Gods diuine wiſdom, which cannot deceiue, and therefore is moſt certain.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Some may Oppoſe. In this Diſcourſe of the Diuine illuſtration, we ſeem to fauour Heretiques, who talk much of their light. It is à ſtrange Obiection, Saith F. Granado. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trou. 1. de Fide. Tract. 1. D.</hi> 5. Whilſt all acknowledge this Light<note place="margin">All Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this Light.</note> to be, <hi>Gratia per Chriſtum,</hi> à Supernatural grace purchaſed by our Sauiour, which raiſes vs aboue the force of natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and moues to belieue moſt firmly, And the Motiue is, <hi>the Diuine Reuelation it Selfe, inueſted or appearing, in God's own Diuine Illuſtration.</hi> To what is pleaded in behalf of Hereticks, I Anſwer. Hereticks talk euery whit as much of their Faith,<note place="margin">Heretiques Claim to Faith and light, makes neither Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine.</note> as of their Light. Do we therefore agree with them in faith, becauſe they Say, theirs is as diuine, as ours? No certainly. For the like ſound of words, implies neither the ſame real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of things, nor any agreement at all. Why then should we fauour the light they pretend to, which like their faith, is à meer illuſion, and no more ſymbolizes with the Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Catholicks, then their faith doth with true Faith?</p>
               <p n="14">14. I ground my Aſſertion on theſe three Principles. S. Paul Saith firſt. <hi>No man can belieue vnleſſe hee Hear's, nor hear without à Preacher,</hi> Therefore in this preſent ſtate of things, an exteriour Humane Propoſition of the Diuine Reuelation
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:102688:303"/> neceſſarily precedes the true light of Faith, and that light is<note place="margin">The Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded light of Hereticks Proued an illuſion.</note> not giuen to belieue, <hi>viâ ordinariâ,</hi> vnleſſe one authorized to Preach in God's name, Propoſes the Reuelation ſuitable to the natural way of hearing other Verities, <hi>by our ſenſes, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi> and <hi>humane vnderſtanding,</hi> Otherwiſe, that would be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible which the Apoſtle makes impoſſible. Viz. <hi>To hear and belieue without à Preacher.</hi> Now further none can be à fit Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to propound the Reuelation, but he that makes his Propoſition good by à Miracle, or ſome ſupernatural wonder, otherwiſe à meer Impoſtor, may as well gain credit by Saying he ſpeak's God's truths, as the very beſt of the Apoſtles. But no Proteſtant, is able to doe thus much, none of them all can ſay with truth. <hi>God has reuealed my particular Doctrin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Firſt becauſe none of them can propound their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, as warranted by Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Signs.</note> add Seal that very exteriour Propoſition with à Miracle, As euery Preacher in the Catholick Church can do, Therefore the illuſtration he pleads for is meer Phanſy, and nothing els.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Again, and here is my ſecond Principle grounded alſo vpon the Apoſtles words. <hi>How shall they Preach vnleſſe they be ſent.</hi> Which is to ſay. He only is fit to Propoſe Gods Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Reuelation, who proues himſelfe commiſſioned to Preach, by Supernatural Signes and indubitable Miracles, For thus Chriſt our Lord ſent by his eternal Father, thus the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſent by Chriſt, and the Church euer ſince (all shewing Wonders aboue the force of Nature) proued their Miſſion; withall euinced, That God only impowred them to teach as they did. Now here is the main point we vrge. Could the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,<note place="margin">2. They haue no Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to teach.</note> who certainly neuer yet wrought one indubitable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to countenance his Doctrin, giue in Euidence by ſome one or other Miraculous work, That an Oracle ſent him to reach, He might ſpeak more boldly, But this being impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, The light he pretend's to, is iuſt like his doctrin, An <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis fatuus,</hi> vain and void of all reallity.</p>
               <p n="16">16. 3. Our latter Proteſtants ſeem to attribute no other certainty to the very act of Faith, then what is moral, and
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:102688:304"/> neceſſarily conſequent to à humane fallible Ratiocination, T' is much like to the Aſſent we elicit, when we ſay <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Pompey</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Their Faith being only moral and fallible, Cannot Proceed from the Holy Ghost.</note> haue been in the world. If this Doctrin be defenſible, its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to declare, how either Faith it ſelfe, or the illuſtration preuious, can proceed from the Holy Ghoſt: For did the Spirit of God work with à Soul, when it belieues, The certainty of Faith, would without all doubt, goe beyond that aſſurance which is only humane, moral, and fallible. Now wee Say quite contrary, That Faith is an abſolute Infallible ſupernatural Aſſent, whereby all ought to adhere to Myſteries moſt profound, or aboue all humane Reaſon, And conſequently, we deriue its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks faith moſt certain.</note> from God's Infallible <hi>Reuelation, inuested</hi> in his <hi>own Diuine light,</hi> and readily return him à double Obedience of our whole interiour, of the Will, and Vnderſtanding together, and belieue moſt vndoubtedly.</p>
               <p n="17">17. One may Obiect. 2. As none can diſcern true Gold<note place="margin">A harder Difficulty.</note> from another mettal very like it, vnleſſe there appear's in the Obiects ſome real Difference, ſo it is impoſſible to diſcern à true Reuelation, from one meerly apparent, <hi>or falſe,</hi> by any Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne light, vnleſſe there be an Obiectiue diuerſity or <hi>diſcernibility</hi> diſcouerable between them, which cannot be aſſigned.</p>
               <p n="18">18. This Obiection (propoſed by no Sectarie) is to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. To ſolue it, I muſt remind you of that Solitary Man Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned<note place="margin">Propoſed by no Sectary.</note> to preach, after his Viſion had in à deſert place, who goes abroad, tell's what he had heard and ſeen in his own natural Language, But gains not belief. He vſeth another Idiotiſm, Speak's in Gods name, and as one ſent from God ought to ſpeak, That is, he euidences his Miſſion by ſupernatural Signes, work's Miracles, or proues them wrought in confirmation of his Doctrin: All now adore him as à Prophet, All belieue. This Language ſome Diuines rightly call an extrinſecal Form of ſpeech, which is Supernatural <hi>Quoad modum,</hi> becauſe it contain's wonders done aboue the force of nature, and proceeds from the Faith of him that teaches, as alſo from the Belief of the whole Church beſides. Pleaſe to obſerue. As mans natural ſpeech, is apt
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:102688:304"/> to beget in à Hearer à natural knowledge of his internal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception<note place="margin">The langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether exteriour, or interiour</note> that ſpeak's, and the thing ſpoken of, So this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Language is apt to beget in one well diſpoſed, à Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural apprehenſion of his internal conception that ſpeak's, and the Myſtery likewiſe ſpoken of. Now becauſe this exteriour Language is God's proper <hi>Form of Speaking</hi> and moſt peculiar to himſelfe, it carries with it <hi>Ex natura rei,</hi> its own <hi>ſignature,</hi> its own <hi>Diſcernibility,</hi> in ſo much that its diſtinguishable from all other<note place="margin">Carries with it, its own diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibility.</note> wayes of ſpeaking which are falſe, or come not from the firſt Verity. And this peculiar mark of God's ſpeaking, (very diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerable) the preuious light of Faith perceiues, as moſt different from all other counterfeited Languages. And thus you haue the Obiectiue Diuerſity ſought for, fully pointed at.</p>
               <p n="19">19.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe firſt Propoſition.

               <p n="2">2. If therefore any Ask why we belieue this or that Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Myſtery; The Incarnation for example? Some Anſwer the<note place="margin">One and the ſame Anſwer returned by All.</note> belief is grounded vpon vnwritten, or Apoſtolical Tradition, Others vpon the words of Scripture, others finally recurr to the Churches infallible Teſtimony. All of them ſpeak but one and the ſame thing, compriſed in theſe few words. <hi>God Saith it, who cannot err,</hi> ſpeaking by One or more, lawfully ſent to Preach.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Inquire again. But from whence haue we Aſſurance that God has ſaid the Diuine word was made flesh, for the Doctrin <hi>to vs,</hi> is neither <hi>Euidently</hi> true, nor <hi>Euidently</hi> falſe? I Anſwer God Himſelfe giues infallible Aſſurance hereof, And who can

Here Faith preciſely conſidered, as an<note place="margin">Vpon what Verity Faith finally relies?</note> intellectual Aſſent, finally reſt's; In ſo much that if you mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply demand's to the world's end, no other Anſwer can be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but this only, Eternal Truth <hi>has ſaid it,</hi> or <hi>reueal's that he</hi>

                  <hi>Speak's this Verity.</hi> All further Queſtions propoſed and replies giuen, though different in ſound are really Synonimal. The reaſon is, becauſe the laſt Motiue of Faith can haue none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it Selfe, for to run on <hi>in Infinitum</hi> with Motiues and ſtop no where, is to make no Reſolution at all.</p>

Experience teaches, how prompt and ready euery good Subiect is to obey his Prince, at the leaſt beck, ſigne, or inſinuation of his will, Though the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation carries not with it ſtrick euidence, yet in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mans Submiſſion to God, when both his glory and our eternal Welfare are Concerned, innumerable ſtand ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering and doubtful, Queſtioning whether God requires firm<note place="margin">The peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical Spiricts.</note> Faith from them, And why?

It doth ſo, becauſe God has shewed by all thoſe moſt prudent and manifeſt Signes already laid forth to Reaſon, that He is the Author of the Doctrin we belieue: In ſo much, that it is not only the higheſt imprudence imaginable to disbelieue, but Wickednes to do ſo, in à matter of ſuch Conſequence. <hi>I ſay Wickednes,</hi> for after à full ſight had of the rational Motiues inducing to Faith (ſeing none can arriue to Euidence of the Myſteries) One of theſe three wayes muſt be<note place="margin">What reaſon forces vpon Euery one.</note> followed. <hi>To belieue nothing.

Now I Subſume. But theſe Supernatural Signes, One only Society of Chriſtians Euidences, and it is no other but the
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:102688:307"/> Roman Catholick Church, Therefore she only propoſes Faith<note place="margin">One only So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Faith which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</note> which is rational, and conſequently obliges all to belieue her Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Hence you ſee that euery one in the Choiſe of Religion, is to ponder in the firſt place, thoſe weightly Arguments which make an Election prudent: And then it is prudent (not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe) when Signes from Heauen Gods own Marks, heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<note place="margin">What makes an Election Prudent?</note> the Religions Credibility ſo far aboue all other falſe and forged Sects, That theſe at the firſt full Sight, appear (as they are) horrid, gaſtly, and contemptible.</p>
               <p n="13">13. If you will Diſcouer more clearly, what I would haue reflected on in this Particular.

               <p n="16">16. But the Church is that firſt Inſtrumental Principle,<note place="margin">The Church, is the firſt Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Principle.</note> and moſt eaſy Rule which teaches our Chriſtian Verities, Scripture teaches them not ſo plainly, Therefore Faith may well bee reſolued into the firſt Verity ſpeaking by the Church and whoeuer reſolues it without all dependance of this liuing Oracle, put's the Concluſion before the Premiſes, as we shall ſee afterward.</p>
               <p n="17">17. I proue the firſt part of my Aſſertion. 1. It is as eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently credible that God ſpeak's to all by the Church, as that he anciently ſpake by the Prophets and Apoſtles, For we haue
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:102688:308"/> the ſame ſupernatural Signes manifeſted in all theſe Oracles à<note place="margin">The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Euident Credibility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> parallel with that of the Apoſtles.</note> like, as is largely shown aboue, and Conſequently haue with them the ſame Grounds of an Euident Credibility, But Euident Credibility; induced the Faithful to belieue thoſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted Prophets and Apoſtles, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Churches Euident Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, euery way Parallel, induces all in this preſent State to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue this Oracle. 2.

The Church, Anſwerable to the Prophets and Apoſtles, is à Liuing Oracle, and vpon that Account able to Solue all doubts which may occurr in controuerted Matters, but the Clarity of à liuing euidenced Oracle, ready to decide all ſuch difficulties, makes the Rule of Faith eaſy, and much auail's to à clear Reſolution. 4.

               <p n="18">18. In the Interim, know thus much. To proue the ſecond<note place="margin">The other part of the Aſſertion it manifeſt.</note> part of our Aſſertion. viz. That Scripture is not à Rule ſo perſpicuous and clear in deliuering the very Chiefe Articles of Faith, as the Church is in controuerted Matters, were to proue à plain Euidence, For what can be more manifes't, then that wee, and all Hereticks pas't and preſent, are at endleſs debates concerning the true Senſe and meaning of thoſe very words we read in Scripture? Yet the Ruel of Faith (Sectaries confeſs it) ought to bee clear open and manifeſt to all. I waue all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe vpon this Subiect, and here adioyn our laſt Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</p>
               <p n="19">19. One demand's, why I belieue that great Myſtery of the
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:102688:309"/> Incarnation? I may well Anſwer firſt. God's own ſacred<note place="margin">The laſt Reſolution giuen.</note> Word, which we call Scripture Aſſerts it. The next Queſtion will be, Why I belieue this to be Scripture? I anſwer. The ſame God ſpeaking by his own Oracle, the Church, affirm's it. A third Queſtion followes. Why doe I belieue that God ſpeak's thus by the Church? I Anſwer the Ground of my Faith in<note place="margin">All De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands anſwered.</note> this particular, is <hi>God's own ſpeaking</hi> and the very ſame with that hee ſpake by the Apoſtles. As therefore his Own word, vttered by thoſe firſt great Maſters, vpheld the Primitiue Faith, without any further ground, or Proceſs <hi>in Infinitum,</hi> So his own Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">Our reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſame with that of the Primiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> by this Oracle of the Church, vphold's mine. And I can go no further; For the laſt formal Obiect of Faith, has none latter, That One word of Truth is enough to belieue vpon. Again, as thoſe firſt pious Chriſtians, had any moued à doubt concerning their Inducements to Faith, would haue anſwered. <hi>The blind ſee. The lame walk, ſtrange Miracles are wrought by eheſe bleſſed men,</hi> And therefore we both muſt in Prudence, and will belieue that God ſpeak's by them; So I likewiſe bring to light the ſame Signal Motiues Euident in the Church, and<note place="margin">The Motiues alike.</note> Say, I both <hi>muſt,</hi> if prudence guides me, and <hi>Will</hi> belieue that God ſpeak's by this Oracle, known as well by Her Miracles and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Signatures, as euer any Apoſtle was known.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And thus you ſee firſt, as I noted aboue, How we paſſe from the <hi>Formal Obiect</hi> of Faith (<hi>God's own Testimony propoſed by the Church</hi>) to the Prudent Inducements of belieuing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Iudgement of Credibility (not Faith it felfe) is vlti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matly<note place="margin">Why we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue?

All dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of à vicious Circle auoyded in this way of reſoluing Faith. For when I belieue that God ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s by the Church, I reſolue not the Belief of that Truth, into another antecedent Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken from Scripture, yet wholly obſcure, and no way ſo immediatly Credible as the Church is, (for if I did ſo, a Proceſs <hi>in Infinitum</hi> would neceſſarily follow) But I belieue that <hi>word of
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:102688:309"/> Truth</hi> for it ſelfe immediatly, and reſt there, As the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians<note place="margin">The word of truth belieued for it Selfe</note> relyed vpon the very words ſpoken by the Apoſtles, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout recurring to any former, or ſurer Reuelation.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I Speak here of Sectaries Obiections, knowing well, ſome Diuines who make the Churches Propoſition moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible<note place="margin">Sectaries Obiections only, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</note> (and herein all Catholicks agree) yet hold it inſufficient to be the laſt Principle, Whereinto Faith is reſolued: For ſay theſe, it is only à neceſſary Condition by virtue whereof the ancient Reuelation is infallibly applied to vs. In this Strife (purely Theological, and ſome what as, I thinke, <hi>de Nomine</hi>) I shall not long buſy my Selfe, being chiefly to attend to what Sectaries do, or can propoſe againſt our Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt Obiection. If the Catholick after à prudent Conſideration had of the known Motiues already ſpecified, can belieue what euer the Church teaches, and Conſequently reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<note place="margin">why Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cannot reſolue their Faith into Scriptures</note> his faith into the Authority of God ſpeaking by that Oracle: Why may not the Sectary as well vpon this one Iudgement. viz. All acknowledge Scripture to bee God's word, as eaſily belieue, and reſolue his faith into pure Scripture, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of Church Authority? Anſw. Such à Beliefe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is impoſſible, becauſe as we ſaid aboue, none can in this<note place="margin">As Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks Doe into the Church?</note> preſent State aſſent to this general Truth. <hi>Scripture is God's word,</hi> or belieue ſo much as any Verity in it, if the Authority of an
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:102688:310"/> Infallible Church be reiected. To the pretended ground taken from the Conſent of all Chriſtians owning Scripture for God's word, I haue partly anſwered. That conſent <hi>alone</hi> induces not any to belieue one reuealed Article by an Infallible act of Faith, if thoſe whole Conſenting multitudes, be all ſuppoſed fallible. Firſt, euery one knowes, the multitudes of Turks agree thus far, that their Alcoran is God's word, yet ſuch an agreement though very Vniuerſal, induces no wiſe man to belieue any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity in the Book, or to own its Doctrin as Diuine, and ſacred. 2. And this reaſon hinted at aboue is, more à <hi>Priori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Agreement of all Chriſtians; is truely an effect of Faith, or rather of the Obiects Credibility antecedently preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed<note place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all, Concerning Scripture is an effect,</note> Credible vpon other grounds, before men agreed ſo vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally in that Chriſtian truth: For this Cauſal is good, <hi>Therefore Chriſtians agreed in that Truth, becauſe it was preuiouſly made Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vpon other ſound Motiues:</hi> And not the contrary. <hi>It is credible; becauſe all conſpired in à Conſent ſo vniuerſal.</hi> Wherefore, if very many, who now own Scripture to be Diuine, should leaue off to iudge So, and reiect the Book or any Part in it as fabulous, That would not diminish its ancient Credibility; And no more,<note place="margin">Not the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Proof of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility.</note> Say I, would the Addition of any new Conſenters, who now reiect it (should, they agree with vs) highten one whit our Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, or make the Truth we Aſſent to more Credible, than it was before. And this proues, That the <hi>Original Credibility</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not grounded vpon any vniuerſal fallible Conſent, but ſtand's firm vpon other ſtronger antecedent Motiues. Nay it cannot Originally depend therevpon, Seing that Conſent is an Effect of thoſe other preuious Motiues, as S. Auſtin often cited, fully and moſt amply declares. Be it how will.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The greateſt Difficulty yet remain's, for if we enquire of<note place="margin">The Sectarles Plea taken from any vniuerſal fallible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is groundleſs.</note> Sectaries, where we may find this common Conſent, we haue but à very ſlippery Foundation to ſtand vpon?

                  <pb n="582" facs="tcp:102688:311"/> alſo called Chriſtians, hold many things in that Sacred Book ſo far aboue all humane reach, that they Say, it is vnworthy God to require from any à firm beliefe of them. Add herevnto the multitudes of Heathens, Iewes and Turks, who imcomparably<note place="margin">whole Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes againſt Sectaries.</note> ſurpaſs Chriſtians in number; All theſe, you know, Vnanimou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly reiect our Scriptures. How then can the far leſſer number of Witneſſes agreeing in one conſent Plead ſo much as probably againſt ſuch multitudes of Opponents, If no other motiue be alleged in behalfe of the Scriptures Credibility, but only the Conſent of few, againſt many.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But to ſilence all Sectaries hereafter, Who inſiſt ſo much vpon this vniuerſal Conſent, we will here <hi>gratis</hi> ſuppoſe the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument drawn from thence to be moſt conuincing, Yet withall Aſſert, it ſo little aduantages the pretences of Proteſtants, That<note place="margin">Sectaries plainly Conuinced.</note> it vtterly ruin's their vndefenſible Cauſe. For where haue theſe men, any vniuerſal Agreement of Chriſtians for their Canon of Scripture? Where haue they it in behalf of their iarring Opinions? Where for their Negatiue Articles? Where for their particular Senſe of Scripture, which not only the Roman Catholick Church, but others alſo reiect as falſe, vngrounded, and Heretical. If therefore this Common conſent for the Bible<note place="margin">Obſerue the Proofs.</note> were more Vniuerſal then it is, it help's not Sectaries, whils't their ſingular Opinions, their Canon and Senſe, And in à word their whole Religion (as Proteſtancy) is ſo particular to Them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, That the reſt of Chriſtians, ashamed to own it, will be no Partners with them.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. A 3. Obiection. If the Church be the <hi>Primum Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibile,</hi> or the firſt <hi>Belieuable Oracle,</hi> whereby God ſpeak's to all<note place="margin">How, and in what Order we belieue the truths Propoſed by the Church?</note> in this preſent State, We are to declare, how and in what order, thoſe Truths are deliuered by it, which all are obliged to belieue: And this cannot be done without Confuſion, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps danger of à Circle alſo We haue partly Anſwered abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, where it is ſaid, That as the Apoſtles after the Knowledge had of our Sauiours Miracles, belieued firſt in à <hi>General way, He was the true Meſsias;</hi> So we, in this preſent State, induced by all the Motiues of Credibility already laid forth, belieue firſt in General, That this Manifeſted Oracle is Chriſts own Spouſe,<note place="margin">This general Aſſent firſt precedes.</note> which infallibly teaches the right way to Saluation. And this truth we Aſſent to immediatly vpon the Churches Propoſition, or rather vpon God's Teſtimony ſpeaking by the Church, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout depending on Scripture; Iuſt as the Apoſtles belieued Chriſt our Lord to be the true Meſſias, vpon his own Teſtimony pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Credible by Miracles, and other Signal Wonders. Thus far there is no Confuſion at all, nor any danger of à vicious Circle. Now further. This General truth admitted, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Beliefe of other particular Verities propoſed, and herein alſo follow the Apoſtles Steps and practiſe, who aſſented to euery ſingle Article which our Sauiour deliuered afterward, vpon his own Word. Why therefore may not we alſo<note place="margin">Afterward we deſcend to other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</note> belieue euery particular Article propoſed by the Church, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the name of God, If (which is already proued) the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me God deliuers Truth as well by this Oracle, as he did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently by the Prophets and Apoſtles.

               <p n="10">10. Thus we ſaid. <hi>Chap. 20. n.</hi> 11.

               <p>A. 5. Obiection. Scripture when newly written, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Euangeliſts or Apoſtles to the Primitiue Chriſtians,<note place="margin">In what ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Scripture was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat to the Primitiue belieuers.</note> was to them ſo total, and compleat à Formal Obiect to ground faith vpon, that they needed no Authority of the Church to compleat it more, Therefore it's ſtill à full and perfect Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of belieuing, in order to all this very.

The Obiection brings with it its own Solution, For if thoſe Holy Writers of Scripture were Infallible (whereof no man doubt's) and propoſed all they wrote as Gods Diuine word, That very Propoſition was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as certain to them, as any Church Authority, whether paſt or preſent, can be to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vs. Hence I ſay, though Scripture was then (That infallible Publication ſuppoſed) à full and compleat Motiue to ground faith vpon, yet now it Cannot be ſo <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="587" facs="tcp:102688:313"/> moſt acceptable, are out of our ſight; Therefore God's Church ſucceed's with her Luſtre, and Supplies, as it were that want, or takes the place of thoſe deceaſed Prophets and Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="13">13.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I Proue the firſt part of the Aſſertion.

This, or ſomething li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke it, muſt be called Faith common to all, For to belieue the <hi>Sacred Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> with other great Myſteries, is no common Faith, becauſe many deny theſe Articles. Now my Aſſertion is. What euer can be conceiued out of the<note place="margin">The Obiect of this Faith muſt either be their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues,</note> Liſt of theſe Negatiues, or is not inuolued in that <hi>Common Faith,</hi> ceaſeth to be an Article of Proteſtancy, <hi>as Proteſtancy.</hi> For example. To belieue one God, is à Tenet common to Iewes, Turks, and Chriſtians, That's no Article peculiar to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. To belieue the Sacred Trinity, and the Incarnation, is common to Catholicks, Proteſtants, and other Heteredox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, therefore no ſingular, no Special Proteſtant Doctrin. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, imagin whateuer can be Imagined, you muſt either<note place="margin">Or à Doctrin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Common to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans.</note> pitch vpon things which no Chriſtian has obligation to belieue, or finally, vpon ſuch Doctrins as Catholicks own, and are diſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Proteſtants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus much Suppoſed, it is demonſtrable, That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant has no Faith to reſolue, who firſt doth himſelfe ſo<note place="margin">Their Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> much Iuſtice as to Cashiere all his own Negatiue Articles from being truths ſpoken by Almighty God, which therefore
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:102688:318"/> are not reſoluable into the Diuine Teſtimony, becauſe God neuer reuealed any of them. Again, <hi>his Articles</hi> common to all Chriſtians <hi>without more,</hi> cannot be reſolued into Diuine Reuelation, vnleſs, he firſt excludes with the Arians, The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of The Trinity and Incarnation, as not neceſſary to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation, And afterwards proues by plain Scripture, or the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of an Orthodox Church, that ſuch an Abſtract Doctrin wherein Catholicks, and all Heretiques agree, is ſufficient to ſaue Souls. But to Euince either, by Scripture or any Church Authority, will be wholly as impoſſible, as to proue, that the Negatiue Articles are Doctrins reuealed by God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Vpon theſe grounds my Propoſition ſtand's ſo firm, that none can contradict it.

Neither of theſe Articles are Confeſſedly truths reuealed by God, And this I aſſert, not only becauſe The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church denies them to be truths, in the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſenſe, But vpon this Account Chiefly, that it is impoſſible, to Show, where or in what paſſage of Holy Writ, God euer ſayd plainly. <hi>Scripture Contain's All things neceſſary to ſaluation:</hi> Or <hi>that ſuch Doctrins as are plainty expreſſed there</hi> (without more) <hi>Comprehend Matter enough to Saluation.</hi> This cannot paſſe for an indubitable Principle, whilſt euident Experience tell's vs, That<note place="margin">VVhat Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. What Verity can be more clear, then the Incarnation of the Eternal word? Yet Arians deny it. What more clear, then the real Preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt?

               <p n="5">5. But here is my leaſt Exception.

The laſt reaſon of all, reſt's vpon à Truth already proued, and T'is, That Proteſtants haue no Eſſence of Religion, and therefore haue no Faith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In paſſing, you may Ask. What Say we to ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, as make the Negatiues now mentioned, Articles of their Faith? Theſe we diſpatch in à word, and vrge them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue their Negatiues by Scripture, which is impoſſible.

But becauſe the recourſe to the Priuate Spirit in the Reſolution of Faith, is amply refuted by euery Polemick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, And now much vnderualued by our latter Sectaries, I'll on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly briefly Propoſe one Argument againſt all that Patronize it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Either this Spirit is Scripture, or really diſtinct from<note place="margin">A Conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Priuate Spirit.</note> Scripture. Grant the firſt. Scripture; <hi>no Selfe euidence,</hi> is yet belieued <hi>for it Selfe</hi> only, and ſo no more is Said, but that Scripture is belieued becauſe t'is Scripture, without all further Probation. If ſecondly you diſtinguish this Spirit or light from Scripture, it followes that the Diuinity of Gods word is Aſſented <hi>To,</hi> and belieued <hi>Vpon</hi> à Motiue, which is not Gods word, For this ſuppoſed Light of the Spirit, not at all contained in Scripture, is no reuealed word of God, and conſequently Scripture is belieued, for That, which is no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="9">9.

               <p n="10">10. This way of reſoluing Faith differ's from the Former, that it makes the pure Verity of Gods word <hi>conſidered Obiectiuely in it Selfe,</hi> the laſt Reſoluent, or the only <hi>Formal Obiect</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing,<note place="margin">How theſe men differ from the Formar.</note> whereas the more aged Proteſtants ſuperadd to that, an internal vital act, called the <hi>Priuate Spirit,</hi> or an infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrinct of Grace, whereby the Scripture is clearly diſcerned to be Diuine, and into this Inſtinct, as à <hi>Medium Cognitum,</hi> or the only means <hi>to ſee by</hi> (which both diſcouer's the Scriptures Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity and it's ſenſe) they reſolue their Faith.

But to clear the Aſſertion from Miſtake, we are firſt To diſtinguish between à nicknamed or miſcalled <hi>Reaſon,</hi> And that which really is Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, There being no word more abuſed, or fallacious than this,<note place="margin">This word, Keaſon, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by many.</note> which vphold's all the Hereſies in the world, Yea and Atheiſm alſo. For Euery Atheiſt, euery Arian, Euery Donatiſt, laies claim to Reaſon, And thinks his own Errour built vpon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Grounds.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I Say firſt. The priuate Reaſon of fallible men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as <hi>priuate</hi> and <hi>fallible,</hi> Diſcerns not eaſily between truth and falshood, chiefly when the conteſt is about this or that particular Controuerly of Religion. The Aſſertion ſtand's firm vpon this indubitable Principle. None can prudently
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:102688:324"/> acquieſce in ſo weighty à matter as Religion is, to that which<note place="margin">The weaknes of Priuate, and clouded Reaſon</note> of its own nature may probably bee clouded with Ignorance and Errour (to ſay nothing of paſſion) And for that cauſe, ſeems vnable to diſcern between Truth and falshood, But the priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Reaſon of falltble men conſidered <hi>as priuate and falltble,</hi> may be ſo clouded, that it diſcern's not between Truth and falshood, Therefore T'is moſt vnmeet to decide in particular Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</p>
               <p n="14">14. To confirm what I Say: Imagin that à Proteſtant and an Arian, were at an earneſt diſpute concerning That which each Party belieues. Both plead by Reaſon. What reſult<note place="margin">An Inſtance</note> think ye can follow vpon the conteſt, whilſt both the one and other may iuſtly auouch, Neither of vs know our own Ignorance or weakneſs? Therefore vnleſs you with whom I Argue can aſcertain me, And I you, That our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is purely diſintereſſed, free from miſtake, and all clouds of Ignorance, We muſt of neceſſity quit this Tribunal of our own priuate Reaſoning, and take rccourſe to ſome Iudge that giues Satisfaction, And finally declares, whoſe reaſon is more reaſonable.</p>
               <p n="15">15. One may Reply, And t'is the only Obiection of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries. Were it poſſible to find our ſuch à iudge (as it is not) the priuate Reaſon of theſe two Diſputants, And of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other particular Man, is, in points of Religion to ponder well the Sentence giuen, T'is He, and no other, that muſt<note place="margin">The chiefeſt Obiection of Sectaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> conclude within his own Interiour, whether the Sentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen be reaſonable or no, And conſequently the laſt Vmpirage, the final Deciſion of all in the choiſe of Religion, is brought to euery Mans priuate Reaſon. <hi>Here is the true Rule of Faith,</hi> (Say theſe) when that choiſe is made; For to ſay Men are damned for<note place="margin">Propoſed in their own Terms.</note> not following the Iudgement of another, whilſt their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hold's it not Reaſonable to do ſo, is harsh Doctrin, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the Principles of nature it ſelfe, And to all Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical liberty. Wherefore though Atheiſts, Iewes, and Turks be Iuſtly reprehenſible, becauſe they abuſe the Principle of
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:102688:324"/> following Priuate Reaſon, yet Sectaries who vſe the Principle with moderation, And euer belieue ſomething within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of Chriſtianity, ſeem not blamable. Here you haue the Ground of all Hereſy.</p>

That God's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deſign in eſtablishing Religion (which compriſes reuealed Truths) was to haue it known or found out by eaſy means, obuious to the Reaſon of euery one, learned or vnlearned. And certainly its far more eaſy, to know by ſenſible Marks and Signatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, where, and by whom true Religion is taught, than with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and almoſt endleſs Scrutiny, to find it out by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning euery particular Tenet, contained in it.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Ground hereof is clear, for true Religion cannot<note place="margin">Two Reaſons shewing,</note> but Shew its own facile, Obuious Marks, and rational Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernibility, Otherwiſe the Ignorant and Vnlearned, would be exempted from all obligation of belieuing, ſeing none can Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the high Myſteries of Faith, without Preuious Euidence of Credibility, laid forth to Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Now if you Reply, The learned in caſe of Ignorance and obſcurity are to inſtruct the illiterate, I Anſwer, That's very<note place="margin">why true Religion is eaſily found out.</note> true, But if after all Inſtruction they bring not the Learner to à due Degree of preuious Euidence, The Inſtruction void of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance becomes both vain and fruitleſs.

<pb n="610" facs="tcp:102688:325"/> Religion, was not to puzzle Mens wits with it, or to ſet them at endleſs debates concerning ſo weighty à Concern, But if it be not obuious and eaſily found out by its own rational, and clear Indications repreſented to Reaſon, There ariſes (<hi>not from Mans malice as now à dayes fall's out</hi>) But from the very Nature of it, euerlaſting Quarrels, which breed diſtaſt, and rather inuite all to loath, then to loue Religion.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Hence I boldly Aſſert, could Religion not be known without ſo many Iniunctions, as Sectaries vſually lay vpon vs.<note place="margin">The Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries way of Seeking is,</note> Were it not attained, before an exact peruſal made of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Councils large Volumes.

Could I Say, none come to the true knowledge of Religion<note place="margin">long, tedious, and diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory.</note> without without fo much Adoe, And ſo many endleſs Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, The moſt of men might well Superſede all further Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, and rightly Iudge, all further Enquiry too intricate for them, being out of the reach of that wee call, <hi>eaſy and obuious Reaſon.</hi> God I am ſure, Diſowns ſuch Perplexity in the Religion he founded, who tell's vs Deuter. 30. 11. <hi>His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> (And what's more ſeuerely commanded then to embrace reuealed Truths) <hi>are not hid from vs, nor farr off.

                  </gap>her.<note place="margin">The Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ariſes from</note> The clear obligation of belieuing ariſes not from Faith it Selfe, nor from the Euidence of the Myſteries aſſented to, for no man ſaith (as is often noted) <hi>I belieue becauſe I belieue, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſee the Diuine Myſteries Euidently in Themſelues,</hi> but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe Hee Speaks thus: <hi>I therefore belieue, becauſe I find my ſelfe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucedently to my Faith, obliged to ſubmit to the Diuine Testimony</hi> with<note place="margin">à clear Euidence, known befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue</note> à moſt firm Aſſent, But that which laies ſo ſtrong an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on him, muſt of neceſſity be à clear Iudgement grounded vpon <hi>Obiectiue Euidence,</hi> nothing leſs certain, can auail in this weighty affair concerning Faith.</p>
               <p n="21">21. I proue the Aſſertion. Whoeuer firmly belieues vpon Gods infallible Reuelation muſt antecedently Iudge, He cannot err by belieuing; or, if He Iudges he may err or be deceiued, it is impoſſible to belieue fimly vpon the Diuine Reuelation.<note place="margin">The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Proued.</note> What I Aſſert is clear; For to Say, I will infallibly belieue becauſe God Speak's infallibly, and withall to keep in mind this Iudgement. <hi>I may be deceiued by my Faith,</hi> is plainly to Say, I doe that which my Conſcience tells me cannot be done, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore that preuious light muſt arriue to Euidence of the <hi>Obiects Credibility,</hi> whereof more preſently.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Now you shall ſee how the force of our Argument hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from the Obligation of belieuing</note> at, is drawn from the Obligation of belieuing. Ask any whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one thought ready to elicite Faith, hold's himſelfe bound to Aſſent with à firm Adheſion, becauſe God ſpeaks; Or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, ſtand's as yet Houering and vncertain, what to doe. In caſe he clearly ſees his Obligation, that neceſſarily implies the euident Iudgement we plead for, And hence ariſes à firm Faith. But if He remains in à wauering Condition, ambiguous whether to belieue or no, He can no more reſolue to Aſſent firmly vpon God's infallible Teſtimony, than one in à Iourney doubting which of two wayes to follow, can prudently preferr<note place="margin">Further vrged,</note> the one before the other. A Iudgement then which bring's all to an inuariahle State of belieuing, is abſolutely neceſſary: And hence Diuines Teach, that none can belieue before he finds
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:102688:326"/> himſelfe obliged to doe ſo, And when Hee ſee's clearly that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, he is bound vnder Sin to belieue.</p>
               <p n="23">23. A further Reaſon hereof is thus, and ſeem's very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing. Whoeuer belieues induced by à doubtful or probable Iudgement, without that degree of Euidence now mentioned,<note place="margin">Pash Faith, blamable</note> may Iuſtly fear leaſt by his too forward Aſſent, He imputes to God à falshood, reckoning that amongſt the Articles of his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſty Beliefe, which was neuer reuealed. This open wrong<note place="margin">Sectaries ſeem to diſown it.</note> Sectaries endeauour to auoyd, who before they belieue the Verities in Scripture, Prerequire à high Moral certainty grounded on Vniuerſal Tradition, whereby Aſſurance is giuen that the Books are Diuine. As therefore à meer probability would be too weak an Inductiue, to lead in that Faith they pretend to; So it would be in our caſe alſo, and Conſequently all muſt Come to à degrce of Credible Euidence preuious to Faith, or Faith cannot ſtand firmly grounded.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Now ſeeing Euidence is neceſſary. There difficulties may occur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerning it. The firſt. What we vnderſtand by the<note place="margin">Three diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Euidence.</note> Euidence hitherto only ſpoken of in General Terms. 2.

               <p n="25">25. Briefly, Euidence in this matter of Religion implies ſo ſtrong à light, ſo great à Moral certainty (at leaſt) That euery well diſpoſed Vnderſtanding, may without fear or heſitancy bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly Say. <hi>God founded this Religion.

Now further, if He bee ſure to Conuince and conquer, Hee doth it by the power and efficacy of rational Arguments, laid forth to all that haue the vſe of Reaſon, For, <hi>He Argues in behalfe of theſe:</hi> But clear Arguments are potent Orators, and plead ſo powerfully that they induce Reaſon to acquieſce, and quit the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all doubt.

               <p n="27">27. I Say <hi>Clear.</hi> For were the Arguments doubtful, all would be left in Suſpence which Religion to embrace. Were<note place="margin">Probability inſufficient.</note> they only probable (<hi>or more probable</hi>) then the pretended Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sectaries, of Arians (for Example) are, They deſtroy

I deny that which the whole world<note place="margin">How Reaſon diſcourſes in this matter of Religion.</note> owns, and is viſible to Senſe. Shall I grant all, and Say its force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or infufficient to induce to belieue that Oracle? I Deſtroy the rational Euidence of Chriſtianity, yea of the Apoſtles Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, And cannot belieue either Prophet or Apoſtle, were ſuch Meſſengers ſent now from Heauen to teach me. For no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prophet, no Apoſtle, euer shewed the like full Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Credibility, as this one Oracle has manifeſted to the world, for fixteen Ages.</p>

Sectaries neuer yet took, nor can<note place="margin">Sectaries follow no probable way of ending Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</note> take the eaſy, right, and Reaſonable way of writing, much leſs, of Ending Controuerſies. This one Principle proues the Aſſertion. As the Truth of Chriſtian Doctrin ſtand's firm, when an Euidenced Church teaches it, So by the Nullity of an Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced Church, you may, in this preſent State, eaſily gather the vncertainty, and falshood of any Doctrin taught Contrary to that Oracle. But moſt euidently Sectaries haue no Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Church which euer taught their Doctrin, or oppoſed ours; Therefore they are impoſſibilitated to write, much more to<note place="margin">The Reaſon why they cannot.</note> follow any short, eaſy, or rational way of ending Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, by an <hi>Euidenced, Oracle,</hi> which yet as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Auſtin cited aboue againſt the Donatiſts ſaith, is, in the firſt place to be found out.

               </p>
               <p n="12">12. I'll tell you à Story for the ſubſtance very true, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning à Diſcourſe between à Pert Nouelliſt, and à Catholick. The firſt would needs debate the Controuerſy of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of Chriſt in the Euchariſt. The Catholick, though<note place="margin">Sectaries manting an Euidenced Church.</note> not very learned, yet of à good Iudgement; willing to ſee ſome effect of the Conference, prudently demanded, vpon what Grounds the Diſpute was to be held on, and finally ended? The other replied vpon Scripture; But ſaid the Catholick, what shall be done, If you and I agree not about the Senſe of Scripture? <hi>Nouelliſt.</hi> We are if things be ſo, to Appeal to the Fathers. <hi>Catho.</hi> But what if we vary as much about the Senſe of Fathers, as about Scripture? <hi>Nouelliſt.</hi> Wee are then to recurr to the Primitiue Church, and examin what Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin<note place="margin">are driuen off all grounds of Arguing</note> She deliuered, relating to our Queſtion in thoſe purer times? <hi>Catho.</hi> O Sr, Wee are yet in Darkneſs, farr off from the laſt ſound Principle, For how shall you and I, after our priuate peruſing thoſe few ancient Records left vs, end our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, whilſt you'l turn them to one Senſe, and I to another? <hi>Nouel.</hi> Reaſon shall end all. <hi>Catho.</hi> That I wish for, But quit me yet of one Scruple. What if your priuate Reaſon be byaſſed one way, and mine another? Or, what if you Iudge that Reaſonable, which I doe not? Here the Nouelliſt like one ſtruck dumb, ſpake not à word.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Yet the Diſcourſe might well haue gone on, for I would haue further inquired, whether to do as all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians<note place="margin">what is to be Iudged reaſonable?</note> in the world, learned and vnlearned haue done, be not reaſonable? None can deny it. Then I would haue infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But all theſe Innumerable Chriſtians, The very Apoſtles themſelues, and others haue vpon prudent Motiues Conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudged it reaſonable, to ſubmit to Myſteries aboue the reach of humane Reaſon, <hi>Ergo</hi> that muſt paſs as à reaſonable
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:102688:330"/> Principle; But the Reaſon cannot be taken from the very <hi>Act</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>of ſubmiſsion, For that is Faith,</hi> nor from any Euidence in the Myſtery belieued, or obſcurely propoſed, nor finally from Scripture alone, for that Book <hi>Conſidered in it ſelfe,</hi> is not its own Euidence, Therefore the Euidence of Credibility, Or the Euidence <hi>Propoſed to Reaſon,</hi> is extrinſecal to what euer I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, and fundamentally lies in the Marks, and Signatures of Chriſts own manifeſted Church.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Hence I Conclude with this Dilemma, and hold it vnanſwerable. <hi>Either God has ſet before all Mens Eyes An Oracle</hi> (which now teaches truth) moſt diſcernable by clear Marks and Motiues from all falſe erring Societies, Or omitted to do ſo. Grant the firſt, Reaſon is as much obliged to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<note place="margin">A Conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> that Signalized Oracle now, As the Primitiue Chriſtians were anciently bound to belieue the Apoſtles. Say Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; There is no ſuch Marked Oracle diſtinguishable from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Sectaries, Reaſon is left in à Labyrinth, and shall neuer find out true Religion, Wherefore Proteſtants who ſeemingly ſtand for Reaſon, and ſlight the Doctrin of our Euidenced<note place="margin">Sectaries vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable.</note> Church, are the men amongſt all other, moſt vnreaſonable, and as dayly experience teaches, meer Scepticks in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p n="15">15. A 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Inference. The readieſt way to conuince à Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary<note place="margin">How they are eaſily Conuinced?</note> (and one though no great Clerk may eaſily do it) is in the firſt place, at leaſt, to waue that long tedious work of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling particular Controuerſies (which depend vpon Authority) and to plead by Reaſon; Thus I would Argue, and haue often done ſo, with good Succeſs. You as à Proteſtant, lay claim to à reaſonable Reformation, and conſequently to à Reaſonable Religion, Say I beſeech you, from whence haue you the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Euidence, which makes this Reformation Credible <hi>to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi> I ſpeak not yet of it's Truth, <hi>for Euidence of Credibility e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

You auouch <hi>it true,</hi> before you make it <hi>Credible,</hi> which<note place="margin">Sectaries auouch their reformation true, before it be made Credible.</note> is to put the Concluſion before the Premiſes.</p>
               <p n="16">16. One perhaps will Say firſt. The reaſon of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſtand's vpon this rational Ground, that wee Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks were deformed, or out of all right fashion in our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Lamentable. And are you the doughty Doctors that muſt mend what was marred, and preſcribe à new Model of Religion? Can you Say what is, or what is not Catholiciſm? It is too much Boldnes not only to teach more learned then<note place="margin">They make à falſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, their Proof.</note> you Selues, But à high Iniury alſo, to make à meer <hi>Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (and very falſe too) to paſs for à rational Proof. You know wee deny your improbable Suppoſition, And you vpon no Principle call it reaſonable. Howeuer; Suppoſe the falshood, that wee are out of Fashion, doth it therefore follow that you are got into the right <hi>Mode</hi> of Religion? No truly; If the Suppoſition ſtand's, wee are both out, And both need à new Reformation.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Some may yet Reply. Sectaries regard not that new coyned word of <hi>Euident Credibility</hi> (à Term wholly Popish) They endeauour to proue the <hi>Truth</hi> of Proteſtancy by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fathers, And to do ſo much, is more than to make it <hi>Credible.</hi> Contra. 1. Were it poſſible (as it is not) to proue the truth of <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> That's beſides the matter here in hand,<note place="margin">They are ſtill beſides the matter now agitated.</note> whilſt wee only Treat of <hi>ending Controuerſies by Reaſon.</hi> Now all know that Authority, whoſe <hi>Credibility</hi> muſt firſt be Euidenced before it haue weight (<hi>preciſely conſidered as Authority</hi>) is not <hi>the Reaſon here ſpoken of.</hi> For Example: I Aſſent to the Myſtery of the Incarnation vpon Gods own <hi>Authority,</hi> that's Faith, but no <hi>rational Inducement</hi> to belieue. What we demand of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is to haue the rational Motiues which induce to belieue <hi>this Protestancy,</hi> laid open before the Eyes of rational men?
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:102688:331"/> Herein we require Satisfaction, but haue none.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Contra. 2. Could theſe men proue their Proteſtancy by<note place="margin">If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued true.</note> Scripture and Fathers, it should, Methinks, be very eaſy to point at an Orthodox Church which Six Ages ſince, publickly owned the particular Tenets of it. Here is my Reaſon. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer</hi> Doctrin the Scripture and Fathers teach, the Orthodox Church conceal's not, but openly Profeſſeth. She is not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if Orthodox, to teach what God has reuealed. Now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Some Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Church muſt haue owned it.</note> Had ſuch à Church euer owned this Reformation, it muſt either haue been like an inuiſible Ghoſt, not perceptible (which our Newer Sectaries Diſclaim) or contrarywiſe diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, by the like <hi>Marks</hi> and Signatures of the Apoſtolical Church, And if their Doctrin was euer taught by it, They are to talk no more of its Truth, before Its Credibility be euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Reaſon, by the Marks and Signs of that Church, which is now ſuppoſed to haue taught pure Proteſtancy. That is in à word, They are firſt obliged to Say plainly, what Articles of Faith, Proteſtants (as Proteſtants) hold Eſſential to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, And then to make ſo much Doctrin, and no more, firſt <hi>Credible,</hi> then <hi>true,</hi> by the known Authority of an Orthodox Church. But This is impoſſible. Hence.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And it is the laſt Inference, whereby one grand Cheat of our Sectaries is diſcouered. Long haue we inquired but without Satifaction, <hi>Where their Church was before Luther?</hi> The Common Anſwer returned by ſome latter. Proteſtants, making little Account of an inuiſible Church, is much to this Senſe. <hi>Our Church was there where it now is, and where it alwayes was, The ſame Christian Church as before the Reformation, Hauing loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that made it ſo.</hi> And if you Obiect. The Church in<note place="margin">How our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. Shuffle.</note> England before Luther was certainly <hi>Popish,</hi> now its <hi>Protestant, Ergo</hi> it is not the ſame Church, They Anſwer and vow it to be the very ſame, though it ceaſed to hold Popery.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Much might be ſaid againſt theſe meer Empty words. I'll here only entertain you with two Reflections vpon the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le. Paralogiſm. Firſt it makes the worſt of Hereſies defenſible,
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:102688:332"/> For might not Arius haue pleaded in like manner. My Church<note place="margin">They make the worſt of Hereſies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible,</note> is where it was beſore, The very ſame Chriſtian Society, though changed into <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> as the ancient Religion in England, now is into <hi>Proteſtaniſm.</hi> So alſo the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> The <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and all other Heretiques could haue Argued, excepting perhaps à few Donatiſts, who confined the whole Church to their little Part in Affrick. Again, As the Thing is reformed., it paſſes with Proteſtants for à Part of the Catholick Church, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>as reformed,</hi> its ſuppoſed à Piece of Reaſonable Religion (Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries<note place="margin">And their Reformation vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</note> pretend not to an vnreaſonable Reformation) And i'ft be So, before the Profeſſors of it talk of the <hi>Truth</hi> of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, They are obliged to make it Credible, by ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Signes, and wonders as an <hi>Infinite Power and VViſdom</hi> (and no other) Propoſes to Reaſon. But all is contrary. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,<note place="margin">Becauſs ſtrip't of all rational Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues.</note> and bring in à Reformation ſo naked and ſtrip't of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Motiues, that none can Say. God himſelfe declares it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, by any Signature, which may bee eſteemed an effect of his Power and Wiſdom, Or in à word Supernatural.</p>
               <p n="21">21. And here in paſſing, You haue the true Reaſon, why Sectaries in their Polemicks, keep cloſe to the Procedure of all condemned Hereticks. The Arians, for Example, neuer<note place="margin">Sectaries fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſtrain of Condemned, Hereticks.</note> went about to giue Reaſon the leaſt Satisfaction, in behalfe of their Rupture made with the Church, but leauing that Rational way, pleaded by Scripture. <hi>So do Proteſtants.</hi> Before they had Shown any thing like à rational Euidence of Credibility, to countenance that shameful Diuorce, They voted it Iuſt. <hi>So do Protestants.</hi> Wauing the Ancient Senſe of Scripture receiued by the Church, they gloſſed it after their fashion. <hi>So do Proteſtants.</hi> Tradition, that ſtrong Tenure whereby the Church hold's Her beſt Inheritance, or Deriues Chriſt's Doctrin down from Age<note place="margin">No Motiues Propoſed to Reaſon.</note> to Age, The Arians ſlighted, <hi>And ſo do Protestants.</hi> But All this while, though we earneſtly wish to hear of Motiues propoſed to Reaſon, whereby this Reformation may be made Credible, we are turnd off with meer Talk, And neuer yet heard, or shall hear oſ more Euidence for <hi>That,</hi> than the worſt of Arians,
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:102688:332"/> can allege for Arianiſm. Wherefore, I conclude, Proteſtancy is an vnreaſonable Nouelty, and conſequently no Religion, for meerly to Say à Religion is true, and from God, before it be made Credible by Supernatural Signes, Vphold's <hi>Arianiſm, Donatiſm, Quakeriſm</hi> and the greateſt fooleries in the world.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Obiections ſolued. Sectaries pretending not to Se the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Euidence, are either blind, or wilfully shut their Eyes. The Aſſertion clearly proued. A Parallel of the Primitiue, and the preſent Churches Euidence. How far Reaſon may be ſayd to Regulate Faith.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. AGainſt our pleading Euidence of Credibility for Catholick Religion manifeſted by the Luſtre of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Motiues, One may firſt Obiect. Euery Mans pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate<note place="margin">Why the Euidence of Credibility is moſt Conuincing.</note> Reaſon is to Iudge whether this Euidence Conuinces, or no, And conſequently the laſt Iudgement belong's to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of priuate Reaſon. I haue Anſwered. The Euidence (vpon two rational Principles) is ſo great that it cannot but conuince, Firſt becauſe the Author of it is no other but God, who certainly was no Impoſtor when he ſet before Reaſon the light of moſt glorious Supernatural Signes, And by virtue of<note place="margin">Two Reaſons</note> them, hath induced both Iewes and <hi>Gentils</hi> to belieue in Chriſt. 2. Becauſe, That which the moſt Wiſe and Learned of the Chriſtian world, haue Iudged <hi>Euidently reaſonable,</hi> May vpon ſo great Authority, be ſuppoſed Reaſonable. But All thoſe Vaſt
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:102688:333"/> Multitudes Conuerted to true Chriſtian Religion, haue Iudged the Euidence of Credibility manifeſt in the Church, both ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and conuincing, Therefore, it is ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence it followes. 1. That the, true Iudgement concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">The Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment long Since giuen, now is not reuerſable.</note> this Euidence, was long ſince giuen, antecedently to the weak Cenſure of this or that particular man, who now would Cauil at it. 2. That all Exceptions made againſt it, are euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnreaſonable vpon this ground, That thoſe Thouſands and Thouſands moſt Wiſe and Learned, who owned the Euidence, And haue been induced by it to belieue; muſt (if Miſled) be<note place="margin">No other Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitable.</note> accounted not only temerarious, but alſo Mad, beſotted, and groſly Seduced by Fooleries. This cannot be Granted. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you'le Say. Thoſe Wiſe and Learned belieued vpon other Inducements, Diſtinct from our Churches Motiues. Anſw. Not one can be Aſſigned diſtinct from theſe, if wee ſpeak of Motiues <hi>Propoſed to Reaſon,</hi> as is proued already.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A. 2. Obiection. Sectaries for all this, Pretend not to ſe the Churches Euidence. I Anſwer; it is not for want of <hi>Light,</hi> but for want of <hi>Ey-ſight,</hi> That is, bebauſe they will be blind Thouſands, As is now Said, as Wiſe and Learned as they, haue<note place="margin">Sectaries want not light, but Eye-ſight</note> ſeen the Light and followed it, Why then do They ſtumble in Darkneſs, when the ſame Euidence is Set before their Eyes? I haue no other Anſwer, but what Truth it Selfe Deliuers. <hi>Ioan. 1. The Son of God,</hi> The Light of the world <hi>came amongſt vs, Et mundus eunt non cognouit.</hi> The world would not know him, Both Iewes and Gentils wilfully shut their Eyes, to the Signal Marks of his ſacred Preaching, And ſo do Sectaries at this day, to the Churches Euidence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some may Reply. What we now Say, is only to Preach, and not to Proue, For how can wee Euince that Sectaries Shut their Eyes to any Light of Euidence? Anſw.<note place="margin">They wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Shut their Eyes</note> Enough is proued Already, Howeuer to come cloſer to the Matter, and to leaue them without all excuſe, I'll Add one word more, which shall be Conuincing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Pray you Imagin, That ſome of our Sectaries had liued
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:102688:333"/> in thoſe happy Dayes, when the Holy Euangeliſts ſet forth the Life of our bleſſed Sauiour, And the Apoſtles preached his Sacred Doctrin to the firſt Conuerted Chriſtians: Would not<note place="margin">An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from the primitiue Euidence.</note> They think ye, haue as readily belieued what euer Doctrin thoſe Bleſſed men then wrote, and Preach't, As the other vaſt Multitudes who came flocking in, belieued? Yes Certainly, Their Obſtinacy, though great; would not haue ſurpaſſed that of Iewes and Gentils, Theſe yeilded, after they heard ſuch Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſpeak, And ſo I think Sectaries would haue done alſo.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now I Demand (and the Queſtion is very pertinent) vpon what Euidence of Credibility; By what prudential Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues laid forth to Reaſon, could Theſe men (had they then<note place="margin">The Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, was not, as ſome may Imagin</note> been in the world) belieued that <hi>S. Matthew</hi> (for example) wrote truely the Life, and Preached exactly the Doctrin of Ieſus Chriſt? Did God Aſcertain all men then liuing by priuate Reuelation, that the Euangeliſt was his Diuine Oracle? Or, did He openly proclaim that Verity to the world by an audible Voice, in the Aire? Was an Angel ſent from Heauen to teſtify, that <hi>S. Matthew</hi> deliuered Truth, and nothing but Truth? Or, was the Holy Ghoſt ſeen in any viſible Form to ſuggeſt all He ſpake and wrote, And to ſecure his tongue and hand from Errour in euery Syllable, in euery leaſt Iota? No. Although God could haue done all this and more, yet wee read of no ſuch Wonders.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Say Therefore, Vpon what prudent Motiues, by what Euidence of Credibility would Sectaries, had they then liued, been Induced (with Iewes and Gentils) to belieue the Words and Writings of this one bleſſed Euangeliſt, or of any other<note place="margin">The Brt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

They went forth and preached euery where; Our Lord working with them, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the word with Signes which followed,</hi> And the Signes are known to all. <hi>They caſt out Diuels, raiſed the Dead, cured the Infirm, Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perſecution, Conuerted Nations</hi> to the Faith of Chriſt; which was one, and perhaps not the leaſt, among their many other glorious Miracles. The great Apoſtle Heb. 2. 4. Speak's moſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:102688:334"/> this Senſe. <hi>God withall teſtifying by Signes and wonders, and diuers Miracles and Diſtributions of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his will.</hi> Here we haue the Apoſtolical Euidence laid before vs, And by it the Doctrin they taught made Credible to Reaſon. Hence I Argue.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But moſt certainly the Roman Catholick Church, and<note place="margin">The Roman Catholick Church only Shewes the like Euidence,</note> no other Society, demonſtrat's the very ſame Miracles, the very ſame Signes and wonders, not one Excepted, as is largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aboue, And to raiſe Her Glory aboue that, which à short, time allowed not the primitiue Chriſtians to Se, Hitherto ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wanted the tryal of à 1671 years Perſecution from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">with an Aduentage.</note> 
                  <hi>Turcks,</hi> Heretiques, licentious Catholicks, and Diuels alſo, And yet, to Gods Glory be it, She keep's Her Poſture Still, immoueable, Inuincible.</p>
               <p n="9">9. One word more. Had we liued in thoſe happy Dayes,<note place="margin">Particulars inſiſted on.</note> wee should haue ſeen or heard of à great Conuerſion, wrought by our Sauiour vpon one <hi>Zacheus,</hi> à Principal Publican, à rich man, and à Sinner. A plain Miracle cries one of the Older Proteſtants, And therefore The Conuerſion comes in with an <hi>Ecce.</hi> Behold the wonder. It this ſo? was it indeed à Miracle?<note place="margin">ſtrange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Ecce.</hi> Behold Innumerable notorious Sinners, accuſtomed to vice Conuerted to the true Faith, and reclaimed from their lewdneſs by the inceſſant Labour of this one Roman Catholick Society.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Again, Had we liued in thoſe Dayes, wee should haue ſeen or heard of à Couragious S. Stephen who ſealed with his blood, that very Doctrin which the Euangeliſts wrote, And the Apoſtles afterward Preached, We should haue ſeen or heard how<note place="margin">Martyrdoms</note> zealouſly the bleſſed man prayed for his mercileſs Perſecutors, And from thence haue concluded, no other but God, gaue the Martyr that Courage to fight on to the end, and Charity to dye as Hee did moſt Gloriouſly. Here caſt your thoughts again vpon the Roman Catholick Church in after Ages, and<note place="margin">Manifeſt in the Church.</note> 
                  <hi>Ecce,</hi> Behold, for one S. Stephen you haue had Thouſands ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Courage, with Charity, and Conſtancy, who as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:102688:334"/> true Valiant Souldiers of Ieſus Chriſt, ſtoutly shed their blood for that very Doctrin, She maintains at this day.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Thirdly, had you liued in thoſe dayes, you would<note place="margin">Contempt of the world in thoſe Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue tirnes.</note> haue heard à new Doctrin preached contrary to corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the worlds Vanity, you would haue ſeen moreouer whole Multitudes of Conuerts, repaire to the Apoſtles, and caſt their wealth down at their feet, calling nothing their own, but God only, who rich in Mercy was their Poſſeſſion; And would you not haue Said, after to great à wonder, ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achers were certainly inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt to teach, And that thoſe who complyed with the Doctrin, were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Seruants of the moſt high God? None can doubt it.<note place="margin">The like in the Church, at this day.</note> Now. <hi>Ecce:</hi> Behold, the very ſame Learning is yet, and has been euer taught in the Roman Catholick Church, And to proue by real Effects, of what Power it is, Thouſands, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowing with worldly Fortune ſlighted all, and to contemn the Vanity retyred Themſelues; Some into Deſert places, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Solitude of Religious Cells, where rich in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, they liued and dyed happily. Thus much, for à hint only.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Beſides, wee haue in this ancient Mother Church, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">More Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages yet. Rules of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteon.</note> great Aduantages of Holyneſs and Deuotion, anſwerable to the Practiſe of the Primitiue times. We want not thoſe, who earneſtly ſtriue to obſerue the higheſt Rules of perfection, and to follow the footſteps of the moſt bleſſed Saints, that now are glorious in Heauen. We want not Means to reclaim<note place="margin">Imitation of Saints. Means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Submiſſion.</note> the moſt obdurate Sinners; and to help on aſpiring Souls in the Exerciſe of mental Prayer, and Diuine Contemplation. We want not Doctrin worthy of God, ſet forth in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Myſteries of our Faith, nor à dutiful Submiſſion to them by the greateſt Capacities of the world. We want not our Faſts, our long Abſtinences, and other Corporal Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications Hard lodging, poor Fare, courſe Apparel, watchings, And the like medicinal Auſterities weary not out, but proue
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:102688:335"/> delightſome to Innumerable, that might haue had both plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure<note place="margin">Fasts and Austerities.</note> and plenty in à ſecular Condition.</p>
               <p n="13">13. By the little here briefly hinted at, you may learn (though à volume might be written of this Subiect) How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the Roman Catholick keeps Parallel in euery particular with that Primitiue and moſt perfect Chriſtian Society. The<note place="margin">The Parallel Euery way, Exact.</note> Euidence of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Credibility is the very ſame in both Churches. The ſignatures of Diuine Power and Wiſdom, are no leſs illuſtrious in the Church at this Day, than when the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les preached.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Hence I Argue, And remind the Reader of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition aboue, much to this ſenſe. Sectaries either Se, or<note place="margin">A moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment drawn</note> will not Se the Euidence of our Church Motiues, already ſpoken of. Theſe <hi>Conuerſions,</hi> theſe <hi>Miracles,</hi> Theſe <hi>Martyrdoms,</hi> Theſe <hi>Auſterities</hi> &amp;c. Appear to them no leſs clear Effects of Gods Diuine Power now, than the very like Signatures or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues appeared to the firſt Conuerted Chriſtians, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Preached. Say; They are no leſs clear, no leſs perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue<note place="margin">From what is Sayd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</note> now, Sectaries are as much obliged to follow this light of Euidence, And to belieue the Church, as they would haue been obliged to belieue the Apoſtles, Had they been Eve-witneſſes of their Wonders, and heard them Preach. Say Contrary. The Euidence of Credibility ſeem's much abated, from what it was in thoſe Primitiue times, I'll firſt vrge theſe Nouelliſts to giue à Diſparity between that ancient Euidence, whereby Nations were Conuerted, And this we now plead for, And if none can be giuen (as manifeſtly there is none) I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they are either blind and Se not, what the whole world has ſeen, Or which is à Truth, that they wilfully shut their<note place="margin">Sectaries Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate.</note> Eyes, and vpon that Account are peruerſly Obſtinate.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Again, Becauſe ſuch Miracles, and thoſe other Signes are manifeſt in the Roman Catholick Church, and in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Society of Chriſtians, I will Demand, what God (for they<note place="margin">Gods Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not, to delude any,</note> are the works of his own Power) intended by them? Was his meaning think ye, to foole the world? To delude poor
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:102688:335"/> Chriſtians? To Contenance and Colour falshood, by His<note place="margin">By His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Wonders.</note> own admirable Wonders? Moſt certainly, No. For, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not only inclined, but obliged all to belieue Chriſt's Doctrin vnder pain of damnation. Again, Truth it Selfe can <hi>oblige none to Erre,</hi> The very light of nature teaches, there neuer was, nor will bee any neceſſity for God to work Miracles, in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation<note place="margin">He loues truth for truth.</note> of Falshood, which He abhorr's, louing <hi>Truth for Truth,</hi> as well in others, as in Himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Some, who for ſtark Shame, cannot deny all our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Miracles, grant many, and withall Aſſent to the other ſignal Motiues already Specified. Yet. 3. Obiect. None of them haue any neceſſary Connexion with Truth. I haue An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered aboue. This Argument either deſtroies the firſt great Euidence of Chriſtianity, manifeſt in our Sauiours wonders and the Apoſtles, or becomes forceleſs. Beſides, the Ground of it<note place="margin">The ground of chis Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, worth nothing.</note> hinted at, is null, For I haue proued already à neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between à Real Miracle, and Truth, vpon this conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Principle. <hi>True Miracles, as is now Suppoſed, are, and haue been wrought in the Church, And by no other but by the Infinite Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="17">17. Others Argue. 4. And more impertinently. Were All that profeſs the Roman Catholick Religion, holy and virtuous, we might better plead for the Churches Euidence of Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, But many, and very many are great Sinners, and this ſeem's much to obſcure Her Euidence.

And to ſolue it, I am once more to lead our Nouelliſts to thoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:102688:336"/> Dayes of the Primitiue Age, and Demand, Whether all<note place="margin">The Anſwer is negatiue, and</note> then, were Saints? No certainly. We read of à wicked Iudas, who betrayed his Maſter, Chriſt our Lord.

Finally we read of an inceſtuous Corinthian, infamous for Luxury, would Sectaries think ye therevpon, haue been diſmayed, or giuen ouer the Practiſe of Virtue, becauſe he was naught? Not at all. For if Wiſe, they know, that Cockle and Wheat grow vp together in the ſame large field of the Church, and it will be ſo (the Goſpel is my warrant) vntil the Harueſt, makes the ſeparation.

               <p n="19">19. In the mean while take notice of it again in the. 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

Some may reply euery Man is to enquire, and Anſwer for Himſelfe. Pitiful That's to Say, we muſt alwaies be Scepticks, euer learning and neuer well taught.

Now to Suppoſe all other Chriſtians negligent, in the Inquiry after God's will, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants only the zealous Seekers, comes neerer to à bold Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; than to any thing like the nature of à Principle.

The General owned Truths (<hi>as that à rational creature may antecedently to any External Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, certainly know the Being of God</hi> &amp;c) no more belong to Proteſtants, than to others. The Doctors falſe Principles, as<note place="margin">Nothing, yet proued.</note> his 16. and 17. are, though Suppoſed true, euince nothing for Proteſtancy, as is already Proued. No more do his other <hi>Controuerted</hi> Principles, denyed by innumerable Chriſtians, proue any thing. His obſcure <hi>Ones</hi> (and his 27 and 29. appear to<note place="margin">The reaſon hereof, brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly giuen.</note> me of the darker ſort) muſt be further explained, For truly I vnderſtand not what is meant by thoſe obſcure words. <hi>Which reiection is no making Negatiue Articles of Faith,</hi> with the reſt that followes.

There are neither Proofs nor Principles, to goe forward withall, I mean, whereby to Euince the truth of one <hi>Pure Protestant Tenet, held by Sectaries themſelues,</hi> neceſſary to Saluation, And I coniure the Doctor (who muſt hold his abſtract Principles hitherto laid forth, very imperfect)<note place="margin">He cannot goe on, and Compleat it</note> to aduance further, That is, to euince by ſome other more immediate Proofs, the abſolute neceſſity of Belieuing one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Article. This cannot be done.</p>
               <p n="28">28. The Reaſon why I Speak thus boldly, is the Verity hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">The vltima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ground of my Aſſertion</note> at in the beginning, and proued aboue. <hi>Proteſtancy as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy has no truth in it, No Eſſence of Religion,</hi> No <hi>One Article Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to Saluation.</hi> And Hence it is, that the Doctor keep's off at diſtance, Or rather run's on as you ſe, partly by aſſuming falſe Principles againſt the Catholick Church; Partly with Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralities, which relate no more to Proteſtancy then to Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Now here in paſſing you may well obſerue The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Procedure of Catholicks, from Sectaries. The firſt tell you plainly what their Faith is.

               <p n="30">30.

<pb n="654" facs="tcp:102688:347"/> is thus. <hi>The more abſurd any Opinions are, and repugnant to the firſt Principles of Senſe, and reaſon, which any Church obtrudes vpon the Faith of men, The greater reaſon men will haue, to reiect the</hi>

I Say, <hi>aboue the reach of weak reaſon,</hi> But not repugnant, as the Doctor ſuppoſes, For no Catholick Verity can be repugnant to Euident reaſon, though much aboue it. In à word. That Doctrin is <hi>repugnant</hi> to Reaſon, from whence two Contradictions clearly follow (now I vrge the Doctor to giue vs any thing like à Contradiction in the Myſtery already<note place="margin">What's Contrary to Reaſon,</note> mentioned of the bleſſed Sacrament) That Doctrin is <hi>aboue Reaſon,</hi> which cannot be known by the ayde of natural Principles only, And thus the Myſtery of the Sacred Trinity, of the Incarnation, of Original ſin, and Tranſubſtantiation alſo, are ſo far remoued from our natural faculties, that none but God only, can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them by his Supernatural Reuelation.

               <p n="7">7. Hauing now done with this Liſt of Principles and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, we may, I hope without offence, iuſtly require the Doctors <hi>Expreſs, direct,</hi> and <hi>Categonal</hi> Anſwer to theſe few follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing Queſtions.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The firſt, and of main importance, though already plainly<note place="margin">The firſt Queſtion Propoſed</note> ſet down, may be thus. What that Eſſential reuealed Doctrin is, now <hi>peculiar to Proteſtants,</hi> and held by them neceſſary to Saluation, which diſtinguishes that Religion <hi>as it is Protestancy,</hi> from Popery, and all known Hereſies?

               <p n="12">12. Hereupon you haue another manifeſt contradiction, and the Doctor shall neuer quit himſelfe of it. In his Rational Account, He grant's à Poſſibility of Saluation to Catholicks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they belieue in à Church ſound (though not euery way<note place="margin">The Doctors open Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</note> ſafe) in fundamentals: Here again, he taxes Her with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Sin of Idolatry, which moſt euidently makes Her Doctrin damnable, and Conſequently Saluation impoſſible to thoſe that<note place="margin">The Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>an ſaue her Children. She cannot ſaue them</note> belieue it; Therefore vnleſs theſe two Propofitions which are Contradictory, be true. <hi>There is â Poſsibility of Saluation in this Church to ſaue Souls. There is no Poſsibility in it to ſaue them,</hi> the Doctors Aſſertions are as euidently Oppoſite to one another, as, if you should Say. <hi>She can ſaue ſoules; And she cannot ſaue them.</hi> Or, She is à true Church, and she is not à true Church.</p>
               <p n="13">13. A third Queſtion. Whereas it is manifeſt and granted by Sectaries, that the Roman Catholick Church once was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:102688:349"/> Orthodox, at leaſt for the firſt three or four Centuries, yet<note place="margin">A third Queſtion grounded, on what Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries grant</note> as our Aduerfaries aſſert, failed afterward, and brought in ſtrange new Doctrins, yea flat Idolatry. We vrge the Doctor to ſatisfy Reaſon in this one particular. viz. Why Proteſtants deal not as Candidly with vs, as we do with them. I would ſay. We accuſe them, for deſerting à Church wherein their Progenitors had liued for à thouſand years, and as à <hi>little Method</hi> lately published, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues excellently <hi>well, Speak open, and acknowledged Euidence;</hi> We tell<note place="margin">How plainly we deal with them.</note> them who began this new Mode of Reformation, we exactly Point at the time of its firſt Riſe, we Shew how it was Propagated, what Abetters it had, and omit no Circumſtance, which may Conduce<note place="margin">And how darkly they with vs?</note> to à plain diſcouery of the whole Nouelty. Sectaries on the other ſide accuſe the Church of <hi>heretical,</hi> yea of <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Innouations, and yet as the <hi>Method</hi> notes, their charge is ſo <hi>obſcure,</hi> ſo vtterly <hi>vnknown,</hi> that the very Accuſers cannot ſay, who firſt publish'd them, Or where they began; from what occaſion they had their Origen? who patronized them? Or who oppoſed them?</p>
               <p n="14">14. Pleaſe now to mark, what my demand is in this place. The Doctor and his Partizans ſuppoſe, theſe and the like wicked Innouations, of an <hi>vnbloodly Sacrifice,</hi> of <hi>Adoring the Sacred Hoſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">what the Doctor is obliged to.</note> 
                  <hi>to haue been euidently</hi> brought into the Church, Contrary to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Doctrin. For that publick act of <hi>Adoration</hi> came not in by night, but was à thing notoriouſly known, notoriouſly practized. Is not therefore the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> obliged, either to tell vs plainly, <hi>when, where,</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> this viſible worship firſt began That is, to proue by <hi>Euidence,</hi> what He ſuppoſes <hi>euidently innouated,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">we accuſe and giue in Euidence.</note> Or, to giue à reaſon; Why when Catholiks euidently proue the Sectaries reuolt from the Roman Church; Proteſtants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vpon <hi>the like Euidence</hi> Proue, that the Roman Church in latter Ages receded from any former Roman Church, pure and Orthodox? Obſerue well the difference. We accuſe them of an actual Reuolt from our Church, (whether they had reaſon for it or no, is not here diſputed) The ground wherevpon our Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation relies, is euident and notoriouſly known. They accuſe as boldly as we do, But when their Proofs come to the Teſt, all of
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:102688:350"/> them dwindle into lame gueſſes, falſe Suppoſitions; in à word into<note place="margin">Sectaries accuſe vpon gueſſes and falſe Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</note> à meer Nothing, as will better appear in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Now here is à Point, I would haue euery prudent Reader to reflect on, for I hold it à manifeſt Conuiction of our Sectaries open Injuſtice. If, whoeuer accuſes à whole Kingdome (euer known loyal) of Treaſon againſt the Soueraign Power in it, ought<note place="margin">A Point worthy Reflection.</note> to Produce no leſs then Euident Proofs in ſo weighty à Matter. Much more ought he or they, who impeach à whole ample Church of high Treaſon, plead by Euidence, or ſit down Silent. The<note place="margin">The Loyalty of the Church euidenced.</note> Loyalty of this Church to the moſt Supreme Soueragn <hi>Christ Ieſus,</hi> is manifeſt. She hath, as is noted in the Other Treatiſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his Empire, defeated his Enemies (perfidious Heathens) gain'd him Friends, and innumerable Seruants. Her repute was neuer yet ſtained by any, nor Fame blemished, but only by Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, Iewes, or known Hereticks. Now Start's vp à little late Knot of inconſiderable Sectaries, who both Cauil and accuſe bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly,<note place="margin">Of what poor Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers are.</note> They impeach this Church of high Treaſon, For, She hath changed the true Doctrin of Chriſt, and in place of it taught, and yet teaches Plain Idolatry: She is therefore à Rebel againſt that King, whom She hath ſerued ſo long, and moſt faithfully. Here is à loud and euident Impeachment, an abhominable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note place="margin">The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment loud and criminal.</note> laid to the charge of à Spouſe, moſt euidently Loyal.

<pb n="661" facs="tcp:102688:350"/> Had he not found himſelfe more then à little in the briars, that is in plain language vnable to Anſwer ſuch Arguments as are preſſed vpon him, by thole two Authors he Slights, He would moſt indubitably before this day, haue replyed to what is Obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">The Dr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes his weaknes in wauing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, which vrge</note> without miſpending time in publishing à triuial <hi>thread-bare Cauil,</hi> as is now done, Concerning the Idolatry of the Roman Catholick Church, which deſtroyes not only Catholick Religion, but Proteſtancy alſo, as is amply Proued in the 2. <hi>Diſc.

               <p n="17">17. The fourth Demand is, and it will giue the Doctor ſome trouble. Suppoſe falſly, the Roman Catholick Church to<note place="margin">what Church Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded in place of the Roman, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed I do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous?</note> haue brought in that abominable Sin of Idolatry many Ages befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Luther, It is euident that when Luther and Proteſtants deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Her, She was far (if Idolatrous) from being the pure Spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of Chriſt, or any thing like an Orthodox Church in the very Fundamentals of Faith. Herevpon à great doubt Occurr's which ought to be cleared. It is. What other Church, neither Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous nor notably erroneous, ſucceded in the Place of this ſuppoſed Peſtiferous erring Roman Society? Such à Church diſtinct from the Roman, free from Idolatry and groſs Errour muſt be Pointed out, and plainly named, or it followes ineuitably that the world was then without à true Church.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Perhaps the difficulty may yet be more ſignificantly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed<note place="margin">Chriſt's Promiſes made voyd. if then there was no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church in Being.</note> after this manner. When Luther reuolted from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church infected, as is now imagined, with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and falſe Doctrin, There was then another Church in the world pure and Orthodox; Or not. If not; All our Sauiours Promiſes of being with the Church to the End of the world (He made no Promiſe of being with an Idolatrous, or any notorious erring Church) are falſe. Again, All that the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le writes. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 14. 11. of the Continuance of Paſtors and<note place="margin">The Apoſtles words alſo, and</note> Doctors in the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of Chriſt's Myſtical body till we meete in one Vnity of Faith (moſt Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he Spake not of any deluded or Idolatrous Paſtors)
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:102688:351"/> are likewiſe vtterly falſe. Nay more, that Article of our Creed.<note place="margin">The Creed falſifyed</note> 
                  <hi>I belieue the Holy Catholick Church</hi> ceaſed to be true in thoſe diſmal dayes, when the whole Roman Catholick Church made Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous went to wrack, and the res't of Chriſtians (if not Idolatrous) were all Profeſſed Heretiques.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Contrarywiſe, if there was at that time another Orthodox Church in Being, when Luther Separated from the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick<note place="margin">What follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes if then there was à true Church?</note> Society; One of theſe two Conſequences neceſſarily followes. Viz. That Luther and his Aſſociates (the Proteſtants) either made themſelues Members of that Imagined pure, Spotles, and Orthodox Church; Or founded à new One vpon their own Authority, neuer before heard of in the Chriſtian world. Now further. It is moſt impoſſible to nominate any ſuch Chriſtians as<note place="margin">Luther and Proteſtants made à new Church.</note> Conſtituted à pure Orthodox Church diſtinct from the Roman Catholick, Therefore Luther and Proteſtants haue by their own Authority made à new One, neuer before known to the world.</p>
               <p n="20">20. There is yet à third Inference which methinks pinches ſuch Proteſtants as Say: They and we make but one Church Orthodox in fundamentals. How can this Doctrin ſtand, if the<note place="margin">The Church, if Idolatrous err's in the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Faith</note> Roman Catholick Church teaches flat Idolatry? For vpon this Suppoſition She err's groſly in that fundamental Point of Idolatry, And conſequently Proteſtants muſt either leaue her as horridly erroneous, or maintain Idolatry with Her. If it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed though thus tainted, She yet teaches ſome few Truths, and Sectaries can exactly tell vs which and how many they are; They<note place="margin">Sectaries improbable Suppoſition.</note> firſt argue vpon an improbable Suppoſition, and ſecondly make the louely Spouſe of Chriſt, beautiful and vgly, treacherous and loyal, falſe and true together, whereof enough is ſayd in the former Diſcourſes.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The laſt queſtion propoſed, is, that the Doctor giue Satisfaction concerning the <hi>Miſsion</hi> of Proteſtants.

How Shall they preach vnleſs they be ſent.</hi> Say therefore, who commiſſioned theſe men, who countenanced them to preach ſuch Doctrins? Dare they tell vs, that as their English Bishops receiued Orders from the Suppoſed Idolatrous Catholick Prelares, So alſo they had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from them (Idolatrous as they were) to teach Idolatry?<note place="margin">They neuer had, nor can haue Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion to teach Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy.</note> Grant this and they make their Miſſion not only ridiculous, but null alſo, and vtterly void of Credit. Whither will they run next think ye? Can they pretend to haue had their Miſſion from the Arians, from the Huſſits, or Waldenſes &amp;c?

Therefore they are vnſent Preachers and conſequently in the Apoſtles Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought no more to be heard, than the Arians or Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Some Sectaries tell vs, its needles to Queſtion their<note place="margin">A reply anſwered.</note> Miſſion, whilſt the Teſtimony of the Spirit aſſures them that they teach the true Doctrin of <hi>Ieſus Christ.</hi> Here is firſt à Suppoſition for à Proof, becauſe The whole world, excepting themſelues, deny what is now aſſumed, <hi>of their teaching truth.</hi> Howeuer, admit gratis this falſe Suppoſition, The meer ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king truth, giues them no Commiſſion to teach it, For Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Vagabonds, and Diuels alſo, may Speak eternal truths, yet are not therefore authorized to preach, or made Chriſt's lawful authorized Miniſters.

The Roman Catholick Church (Say they) though once ſound and Orthodox, yet in after Ages turned from God, betrayed his truths, brought in Idolatry and damnable Hereſies. Hence it is we boldly accuſe her, hence it is we write againſt her notorious Errours, and out of loue to our Souls leaue Her. <hi>Nos iuſſu diuino, Babylone Egreſsi,</hi> Saith Riuet, in <hi>Sum.

They would certainly not be ſatisfied with leſſer proofs then euident. Hence it is, that we in like manner, exact neither Topicks, nor gueſſes, but clear Euidence againſt the ſuppoſed errours of our Church; and reaſonably do ſo, Firſt becauſe, She by God's Special Prouiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, hath hitherto preſerued Scriptures pure, without Corruptions in Doctrin. 2.
